## 📖 ANSWER EXPLANATIONS

**1. B** — Marketing Service Agreements (MSAs) are scrutinized under RESPA §8. A flat fee arrangement where no bona fide marketing services are documented or delivered is a kickback regardless of structure.

**2. B** — Under TILA, the right of rescission can ONLY be waived in a documented bona fide personal financial emergency (e.g., imminent loss of home). A simple desire for fast funds does not qualify.

**3. C** — Government monitoring information (race, ethnicity, sex) is collected to comply with HMDA fair lending reporting. It is NOT used in underwriting decisions.

**4. C** — HMDA requires reporting the action taken on every reportable application. A borrower-withdrawn application is reported as "withdrawn." Incomplete applications are also reportable.

**5. B** — Intentionally breaking up cash transactions to avoid CTR reporting thresholds is "structuring" — a federal crime under the Bank Secrecy Act, regardless of whether the underlying funds are legal.

**6. B** — Under fair lending and the Fair Housing Act, lenders must consider reasonable accommodation requests from disabled applicants. However, they are not required to fundamentally alter their underwriting standards.

**7. D** — An increase in a service the borrower selected from the lender's written list of providers is a valid changed circumstance (within 10% aggregate tolerance category), allowing a revised LE.

**8. B** — When moving from a federally regulated depository institution to a non-bank lender, the MLO transitions from "registered" to "licensed" status and must obtain a state license through NMLS.

**9. B** — RESPA requires lenders to perform an escrow account analysis at least once annually (typically at the loan's anniversary date) to ensure the account is properly funded.

**10. B** — The ATR rule requires lenders to make a good-faith, reasonable determination of the borrower's ability to repay based on verified income, assets, employment, current debt obligations, credit history, and monthly payments.

**11. C** — TILA Reg Z "trigger terms" for advertising require disclosure of down payment, loan term, APR, and payment amounts. A borrower's credit score is not a required disclosure in advertising.

**12. A** — ECOA generally prohibits requiring spousal signatures. However, if state property law gives the non-applicant spouse a property interest (e.g., community property states), requiring their signature on the mortgage may be permissible.

**13. B** — HMDA requires reporting of applications (complete applications that move forward). A pre-qualification inquiry where no formal application is taken does not trigger HMDA reporting.

**14. A** — An escrow shortage is the difference between the minimum required balance and the actual balance in the escrow account. A shortage can be collected over 12 months. A deficiency is when the balance goes negative.

**15. B** — The SAFE Act's temporary authority (TA) provision (added by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act) allows MLOs transitioning from banks or across state lines to originate while their application is pending.

**16. B** — NMLS is a licensing system/database, not a regulatory agency. Consumer complaints about MLO conduct are investigated by the state licensing agency in the state where the conduct occurred.

**17. B** — A voluntary surrender of a license is a public record in NMLS. Future licensing applications must disclose it and licensing authorities may treat it similarly to a revocation in evaluating the applicant's fitness.

**18. B** — The "home state" in NMLS multi-state licensing typically refers to the state of primary licensure — often the state where the MLO originates most loans — which may form the basis for reciprocity with other states.

**19. B** — A lapsed license typically requires completing any outstanding CE, paying reinstatement fees, and meeting current licensing requirements. Retaking the exam may be required if the lapse is extended (often beyond 5 years).

**20. C** — VA loans are assumable by qualified buyers (including non-veterans). However, when assumed by a non-veteran, the original veteran's VA loan entitlement remains tied to the assumed loan and is not restored until the loan is paid off or refinanced out.

**21. C** — A HECM (Home Equity Conversion Mortgage) — the FHA-insured reverse mortgage — allows seniors 62+ to convert home equity into income without required monthly payments, which fits her need perfectly.

**22. A** — The note rate determines the monthly payment calculation. The APR incorporates the note rate plus certain fees (origination, points, mortgage insurance) to show the loan's true annual cost.

**23. B** — Monthly interest = $200,000 × 6% ÷ 12 = $1,000. Payment = $1,200. Principal portion = $1,200 − $1,000 = $200. Early in the loan, the vast majority goes to interest.

**24. A** — Under RESPA's servicing transfer rules, borrowers must receive written notice at least 15 business days before a servicing transfer takes effect, from both the old and new servicer.

**25. B** — With a 2/2/6 cap and a 5.00% start rate, the maximum rate after the FIRST adjustment (after the 3-year initial period) is 5.00% + 2.00% (first adjustment cap) = 7.00%.

**26. B** — A temporary buydown (like a 2-1 buydown) reduces the rate for the first 1-2 years then reverts to the full note rate. A permanent buydown (discount points) reduces the rate for the entire loan term.

**27. B** — Many loan programs (FHA, VA, conventional) have restrictions on seller-carried seconds counting toward the required down payment. The MLO must verify program eligibility for the seller financing structure.

**28. C** — The Homeowners Protection Act requires automatic PMI cancellation when the LTV reaches 78% based on the original loan's amortization schedule and original property value (not current market value).

**29. A** — A subordination agreement is a legal agreement in which the junior lienholder (e.g., HELOC lender) agrees to remain in a subordinate lien position when the first mortgage is refinanced.

**30. B** — A Verification of Rent (VOR) completed and signed by the landlord is the most reliable documentation of rental payment history. Bank statements can supplement but individual landlords may not have formal records.

**31. B** — Stale comparable sales (over 12 months old) may not accurately reflect current market conditions. The MLO should flag this through the lender's appraisal review process, not contact the appraiser directly.

**32. B** — For non-occupying co-borrower transactions on a single-family home under conventional guidelines, the maximum LTV is typically 80% (family relationships may allow higher LTV in some cases under specific guidelines).

**33. B** — A commitment letter is the lender's formal, binding commitment to fund the loan after full underwriting. It lists remaining conditions (PTF conditions) but commits the lender to lend if conditions are met.

**34. B** — A float-down option gives the borrower the right to reduce their locked rate if market rates drop during the lock period. It typically comes at a cost (fee or higher rate) and may have restrictions on when it can be exercised.

**35. B** — TILA requires the borrower to acknowledge receipt of the Loan Estimate (and have 3 business days to review it) before a lender may collect fees beyond a credit report fee. Ordering the appraisal (a borrower-paid fee) before this is a violation.

**36. A** — Earnest money that has already cleared should be documented with bank statements from the month the check cleared, showing the debit. If the closing statement references it, that typically suffices at closing.

**37. A** — Use of a Power of Attorney at closing requires advance approval from the lender and title company to ensure the POA is valid, specific, and acceptable for mortgage transactions. Many lenders have strict POA requirements.

**38. C** — Appraisal Independence Requirements (AIR policy, per Fannie Mae) prohibit any party with an interest in the transaction from pressuring an appraiser to reach a target value. Telling an appraiser to "make the numbers work" is a clear violation.

**39. C** — Back-end DTI = Total Monthly Debt ÷ Gross Monthly Income = $2,800 ÷ $7,000 = 40%.

**40. B** — FICO scoring groups mortgage-related inquiries within a 14-45 day window (depending on the FICO version) and counts them as a single inquiry, recognizing rate-shopping behavior.

**41. C** — Cash rent payments to a relative cannot be verified through traditional means (canceled checks, bank statements clearly showing rent). Without documentation confirming the payments' purpose, underwriters cannot use this as rental history.

**42. A** — A hazard insurance binder (or declarations page) confirms the homeowner's insurance policy is active, identifies coverage amounts, and names the lender as an additional insured/mortgagee — required at closing.

**43. B** — GLBA requires financial institutions to provide a privacy notice and give consumers the right to opt out of having their nonpublic personal information shared with non-affiliated third parties (including affiliated insurance companies without consent).

**44. B** — Rates are individualized based on credit score, LTV, loan type, points paid, market conditions, and other factors. The honest answer is to explain the factors that determine the borrower's rate.

**45. C** — When an MLO discovers fraud in the application, they must stop processing the loan, report it to their supervisor/compliance department, and document the discovery. Continuing to process would make the MLO complicit.

**46. B** — "Ghost MLO" fraud (also called loan splitting) involves falsely attributing loans to another MLO's NMLS number to spread production, circumvent licensing requirements, or manipulate compliance thresholds.

**47. C** — Most federal regulations (TILA, RESPA, ECOA) require loan records to be retained for a minimum of 3 years from the date of the credit decision or closing. Some records (e.g., HMDA LAR) have longer requirements.

**48. B** — A financial relationship with a settlement service provider constitutes an affiliated business arrangement. An AfBA disclosure must be provided each time the MLO refers a borrower to that provider, regardless of direct compensation.

**49. B** — Under the Bank Secrecy Act's Red Flags Rule (implemented by the FTC and banking regulators), financial institutions must have identity theft prevention programs to detect and respond to identity theft red flags.

**50. C** — Accepting gifts of significant value from real estate developers or other referral sources creates a quid pro quo arrangement that can violate RESPA §8. Even without an explicit agreement, substantial gifts from referral partners raise RESPA concerns.
