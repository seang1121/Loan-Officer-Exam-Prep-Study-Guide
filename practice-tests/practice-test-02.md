## 📖 ANSWER EXPLANATIONS

**1. C** — Mortgage broker fees are finance charges under TILA. Appraisal fees, title fees (when borrower shops), and hazard insurance are excluded finance charges.

**2. B** — RESPA §8 allows compensation for services actually and legitimately performed. Pure referral fees with no services rendered are prohibited.

**3. B** — The APR tolerance for regular loans is 0.125%. A change from 6.00% to 6.14% = 0.14% — exceeds tolerance, requiring a revised LE and new 3-business-day wait.

**4. C** — HMDA requires collection of race/ethnicity, income, loan purpose, and other demographic/loan data. It does NOT require disclosure of the MLO's compensation.

**5. B** — SARs are required for transactions of $5,000 or more involving suspected illegal activity. CTRs are for cash transactions over $10,000 (two different reports).

**6. B** — Extended rescission up to 3 years applies when required TILA disclosures were not properly delivered to the borrower.

**7. B** — AfBA disclosure must be given at the time of the referral to the affiliated settlement service provider.

**8. C** — Under ECOA, a counteroffer is open for 90 days. After 90 days with no acceptance, the lender must send an adverse action notice.

**9. C** — HMDA covers loans secured by dwellings. A commercial loan secured only by a warehouse (no residential component) is not covered.

**10. B** — The 20-hour pre-licensing breakdown is: 3 hrs federal law, 3 hrs ethics, 2 hrs non-traditional products, 12 hrs electives. Option B (3 hrs federal law) is correct.

**11. C** — Disparate impact occurs when a neutral, uniformly applied policy creates a statistically significant adverse effect on a protected class. Disparate treatment requires intent.

**12. B** — FCRA gives CRAs 30 days to investigate a consumer dispute (extended to 45 days if the consumer provides additional information).

**13. C** — HOEPA requires a special disclosure at least 3 business days before consummation. Negative amortization, balloon payments in first 5 years, and pre-payment penalties are generally prohibited.

**14. D** — Under the LO Comp Rule, compensation cannot be tied to interest rate, APR, points, or any other loan term. Volume-based, geography-based, and transaction-type differences are generally permitted.

**15. C** — A surety bond protects consumers (and sometimes the state) from financial harm caused by an MLO's unlawful conduct — not the lender or the MLO.

**16. B** — When an MLO changes employers and the new sponsor has not yet accepted/approved the NMLS sponsorship, the license goes into inactive status until sponsorship is active.

**17. C** — A misdemeanor traffic offense is generally not a disqualifying event. Felony fraud, breach of trust, and recent drug felonies are automatic disqualifiers under the SAFE Act.

**18. A** — The 8-hour CE requirement breaks down as: 3 hrs federal law, 2 hrs ethics, 2 hrs non-traditional mortgage products, 1 hr electives.

**19. C** — Being named in a civil lawsuit related to mortgage activities is a material change requiring NMLS amendment within 30 days.

**20. A** — PITI = Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance. This represents the total monthly housing payment used in DTI calculations.

**21. B** — A 2-1 buydown temporarily reduces the rate by 2% in year 1 and 1% in year 2, then the rate returns to the full note rate in year 3.

**22. B** — Conforming loans meet Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac purchase guidelines, including loan limits and underwriting criteria. FHA loans are government loans, not conforming.

**23. A** — An 80-10-10 is a first mortgage at 80% LTV, a second mortgage (piggyback) at 10%, and a 10% cash down payment — used to avoid PMI.

**24. B** — A balloon mortgage has lower (often interest-only or partially amortizing) payments during the term, with a large lump-sum payment due at maturity.

**25. C** — LTV = Loan Amount ÷ Appraised Value = $400,000 ÷ $450,000 = 88.9%, rounded to approximately 89%.

**26. B** — Discount points are prepaid interest (1 point = 1% of loan amount) paid at closing to buy down the interest rate on the loan.

**27. B** — A bridge loan provides short-term financing using existing home equity, bridging the gap between purchasing a new home and selling the current one.

**28. B** — A construction-to-permanent loan (also called a one-time close) funds the build phase and automatically converts to a permanent mortgage at completion.

**29. C** — A HELOC is a revolving line of credit (like a credit card) secured by home equity. It typically has a variable rate during the draw period.

**30. C** — Payment history is the most heavily weighted factor in FICO scoring (approximately 35% of the score).

**31. B** — FHA requires a gift letter confirming the funds are a gift (not a loan) and documentation showing the transfer occurred. The 60-day seasoning rule applies to funds already in the account.

**32. B** — Reserves are liquid assets (savings, investments) equal to a specified number of months of PITI payments, verified AFTER down payment and closing costs.

**33. B** — Fannie Mae's Desktop Underwriter issues Approve/Eligible (loan meets guidelines), Refer (manual underwriting needed), or Refer with Caution (high-risk) findings.

**34. B** — When an appraisal comes in low, the lender must use the lower appraised value, which affects LTV, PMI requirements, and sometimes DTI if the down payment increases.

**35. B** — A prior-to-funding condition is one that must be satisfied before the lender will wire funds on the closing date (e.g., proof of insurance, final pay stub, HOA certification).

**36. B** — Title insurance protects against losses from title defects (undiscovered liens, ownership disputes, recording errors) that existed before the policy was issued.

**37. C** — A verbal promise of a future raise is not documentable or verifiable income. All qualifying income must be documented and have a reasonable expectation of continuance.

**38. C** — Fannie Mae guidelines do not require all collection accounts to be paid. The underwriter (and AUS) makes the determination based on the overall credit profile and risk assessment.

**39. C** — Homeowner's insurance for the first year is a prepaid item — money paid in advance for future coverage. Origination fees, appraisal fees, and title insurance are closing cost fees.

**40. A** — Federal law (the National Flood Insurance Reform Act) requires flood insurance as a condition of federally backed mortgages for properties in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).

**41. B** — Wire fraud/business email compromise (BEC) is the most common form of closing fraud — cybercriminals intercept emails and send fake wiring instructions to divert closing funds.

**42. B** — A VOE confirms employment facts (employer, position, income, tenure) but does not assess the borrower's probability of continued employment — that's an underwriting judgment call.

**43. B** — Disparate treatment is intentional discrimination: treating an applicant differently because of a protected class characteristic. It requires intent. Disparate impact does not.

**44. A** — GLBA requires financial institutions (including mortgage lenders) to provide an annual privacy notice explaining how customer nonpublic personal information is collected and shared.

**45. B** — Even without money changing hands, a quid pro quo referral arrangement (I send you business, you send me business) may violate RESPA §8's prohibition on unearned referral fees.

**46. B** — Predatory lending is defined by loan products with abusive, unfair, or deceptive terms that strip equity or exploit borrowers — often targeting vulnerable or unsophisticated consumers.

**47. B** — Advertising a "guaranteed" rate without actually being able to guarantee it is a deceptive practice under UDAAP. Consumers are misled about a material fact.

**48. C** — Occupancy fraud is mortgage fraud. The MLO must refuse to originate the loan on false terms and document the situation to protect themselves from liability.

**49. B** — Net tangible benefit requires that a refinance or new loan product provides a real, measurable financial benefit to the borrower — not just closing costs financed into the loan.

**50. C** — The fundamental ethical duty of an MLO is to serve the borrower fairly and transparently, providing suitable loan products and honest guidance throughout the transaction.
