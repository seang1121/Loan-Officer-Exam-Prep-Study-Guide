# NMLS Exam Prep — Scenario Bank
## 60 Real-World MLO Scenarios

Use these to practice applying knowledge, not just recalling facts.
Each scenario mirrors the situational-judgment style of actual NMLS exam questions.

**Instructions:** Read the full scenario before choosing an answer. These test your judgment, not just definitions.

## 🏛️ SECTION A: Compliance & Fair Lending (Scenarios 1–15)

---

**Scenario 1**
A borrower of Middle Eastern descent applies for a $320,000 purchase loan. The MLO qualifies them at 6.75% with no issues. A similarly qualified White borrower applies the next day and is offered 6.25%. Both have the same credit score, LTV, and income. What law is most likely being violated, and what type of discrimination is this?

- A) HMDA — disparate impact
- B) Fair Housing Act / ECOA — disparate treatment
- C) RESPA Section 8 — unearned fee
- D) TILA — APR misrepresentation

**Answer: B** — Offering different rates to similarly qualified borrowers based on national origin is intentional disparate treatment, violating both the Fair Housing Act and ECOA.

---

**Scenario 2**
A mortgage company instructs its MLOs to avoid taking loan applications from properties in ZIP codes 32206 and 32209, which are predominantly Black neighborhoods. The stated reason is "credit risk in that area." What violation has occurred?

- A) Steering
- B) Redlining
- C) Reverse redlining
- D) Churning

**Answer: B** — Refusing to lend in geographic areas based on the racial/ethnic composition of those neighborhoods is redlining — a clear Fair Housing Act and ECOA violation.

---

**Scenario 3**
A borrower is a single mother receiving child support income. The MLO tells her, "We don't count child support as qualifying income." In fact, the lender does accept documented child support income. What violation is this?

- A) RESPA — undisclosed affiliate arrangement
- B) ECOA — discrimination based on familial status or receipt of public assistance
- C) TILA — failure to disclose APR
- D) HMDA — failure to collect monitoring data

**Answer: B** — ECOA prohibits discrimination based on familial status and the receipt of income from public assistance programs. Refusing to count legitimate, documented income on these grounds is a violation.

---

**Scenario 4**
A lender's policy requires all applicants to have a U.S. citizen co-signer if they are on a visa, regardless of income, assets, or credit score. An applicant from Brazil is denied under this policy. Which violation has most likely occurred?

- A) TILA — failure to properly disclose the loan terms
- B) ECOA / Fair Housing Act — discrimination based on national origin
- C) RESPA Section 8 — referral fee arrangement
- D) SAFE Act — unlicensed mortgage activity

**Answer: B** — A blanket co-signer requirement targeting applicants based on national origin (visa status used as a proxy) violates ECOA and the Fair Housing Act.

---

**Scenario 5**
A large bank analyzes its loan approval data and finds that its standard minimum loan amount of $75,000 results in a statistically significant denial rate for applicants in lower-income, predominantly minority areas (where home values are lower). The bank did not intend to discriminate. What type of fair lending concern exists?

- A) Disparate treatment — intent to discriminate is proven
- B) Redlining — geographic exclusion
- C) Disparate impact — a facially neutral policy creates an unequal outcome on a protected class
- D) Reverse redlining — targeting minority areas with inferior products

**Answer: C** — A facially neutral policy (minimum loan amount) that statistically harms a protected class creates disparate impact liability even without discriminatory intent.

---

**Scenario 6**
An MLO is reviewing a Loan Application Register and notices the company has a very low approval rate for female applicants compared to male applicants with similar credit profiles. The MLO should:

- A) Ignore it — approval rates naturally vary by demographic
- B) Bring it to the attention of the compliance department for a fair lending analysis
- C) Begin approving more female applicants at higher DTIs to balance the data
- D) Report directly to HUD before notifying the company

**Answer: B** — Statistical disparities in approval rates are a HMDA red flag for fair lending violations. The appropriate step is escalating to compliance for review — not unilaterally adjusting underwriting standards.

---

**Scenario 7**
A title company gives an MLO's company free office space worth $2,400 per month. In exchange, the MLO's company refers all their clients to that title company. No written agreement exists. Under RESPA, this arrangement is:

- A) Permissible if no written contract documents the arrangement
- B) Permissible as long as the title company is competitively priced
- C) A RESPA Section 8 violation — the office space is a thing of value exchanged for referrals
- D) Permitted because office space is not a settlement service fee

**Answer: C** — RESPA §8 prohibits any "thing of value" exchanged for referral of settlement services business. Free office space is a thing of value, and the arrangement is a quid pro quo referral scheme regardless of whether a written contract exists.

---

**Scenario 8**
An MLO refers clients exclusively to a home inspector owned by their brother-in-law. No money changes hands. The MLO never discloses this relationship to borrowers. Which law requires disclosure here?

- A) TILA — conflict of interest disclosures
- B) RESPA — Affiliated Business Arrangement disclosure
- C) ECOA — adverse action notice
- D) FCRA — credit report disclosure

**Answer: B** — A family relationship that creates a financial connection between the MLO and the settlement service provider constitutes an affiliated business arrangement. RESPA requires an AfBA disclosure at the time of the referral.

---

**Scenario 9**
A lender offers a "special" loan product with a 10% interest rate, a 3-year balloon payment, and a 5% prepayment penalty — marketed specifically to elderly homeowners in retirement communities. The MLO knows these borrowers could qualify for a standard 6.5% conventional loan. This is most accurately described as:

- A) Redlining
- B) Steering / reverse redlining / predatory lending
- C) Dual compensation
- D) Churning

**Answer: B** — Targeting a vulnerable population (elderly borrowers) with inferior, abusive loan products they don't need — when they qualify for better terms — is predatory lending and reverse redlining (targeting a demographic group with harmful products).

---

**Scenario 10**
An MLO receives a referral fee from an online lead generation company: $150 per funded loan for each lead the site sends. The MLO pays nothing and provides no service to the lead company. Under RESPA §8, this arrangement:

- A) Is permissible because the lead company is not a settlement service provider
- B) Is permissible as long as the fee is disclosed on the LE
- C) May violate RESPA §8 if the lead company itself performs settlement services on those loans
- D) Is always permissible since lead generation is exempt from RESPA

**Answer: C** — If the lead generator is also a settlement service provider, receiving a fee per funded loan could constitute a RESPA §8 violation. Pure lead generation (no settlement services) may be exempt, but the MLO should confirm the company's role before accepting per-loan fees.

---

**Scenario 11**
Under HMDA, which of the following is the correct way to collect race/ethnicity data when a borrower refuses to provide it on a face-to-face application?

- A) Leave the field blank and note "refused"
- B) Note "information not provided" and, if a face-to-face interview, use visual observation and surname to assign the data
- C) Deny the application — refusing to provide monitoring data is grounds for denial
- D) Only collect it if the borrower agrees in writing

**Answer: B** — For face-to-face applications, HMDA regulations require the lender to collect monitoring information by visual observation or surname if the applicant refuses. The lender marks "information not provided by applicant in mail, internet, or telephone application" if applicable. Denying a loan based on refusal is a violation.

---

**Scenario 12**
A borrower with a disability asks for loan documents in large-print format as a reasonable accommodation. The lender refuses, saying it's "too burdensome." Under the Fair Housing Act, this refusal:

- A) Is acceptable — lenders are not required to provide alternative document formats
- B) May constitute a Fair Housing violation for failure to provide a reasonable accommodation
- C) Is permissible if the borrower can use a standard magnifying glass
- D) Must be reviewed by HUD before the lender can make a decision

**Answer: B** — Lenders are required under the Fair Housing Act to provide reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities unless doing so causes an undue hardship. Providing large-print documents is generally considered a reasonable accommodation.

---

**Scenario 13**
An MLO is advertising on social media. A post reads: "Get a home loan! Rates as low as 4.99%." Under Regulation Z, what else must this advertisement include?

- A) Nothing — social media posts are not subject to Reg Z
- B) The APR, if a rate is mentioned, plus other required disclosures if a payment amount triggers additional disclosures
- C) Full LE terms including closing costs
- D) The MLO's NMLS ID only

**Answer: B** — Under Reg Z, advertising a specific rate (a trigger term) requires disclosure of the APR. Additional disclosures (down payment, loan term, payment amount) are required if other trigger terms are included. NMLS ID and company name are also required in advertising.

---

**Scenario 14**
A borrower's application is denied. The lender mails the adverse action notice 45 days after the decision. Under ECOA, the required timeframe is:

- A) 15 business days
- B) 30 days
- C) 60 days
- D) No specific timeframe — just "promptly"

**Answer: B** — ECOA requires notification of credit action (approval, denial, counteroffer, or incomplete) within **30 days** of receiving a completed application. Mailing at 45 days is a violation.

---

**Scenario 15**
An appraisal comes in with a value lower than the purchase price. The seller is a protected class minority. The buyer's agent claims the appraiser discriminated. Who has jurisdiction to investigate an appraisal discrimination complaint?

- A) NMLS — it licenses appraisers and MLOs
- B) HUD — which enforces the Fair Housing Act, including discriminatory appraisals
- C) The CFPB — which regulates all residential mortgage activity
- D) The state banking department — which licenses appraisers

**Answer: B** — The Fair Housing Act prohibits discriminatory appraisals. HUD (and private plaintiffs) can bring fair housing claims against appraisers who discriminate in their valuations. The CFPB has authority over lender conduct; HUD covers the Fair Housing Act broadly.

---

## 📋 SECTION B: TRID & Disclosure Scenarios (Scenarios 16–27)

---

**Scenario 16**
A borrower submits a complete application on Monday. The Loan Estimate is emailed to the borrower on Friday (4 business days later). Has TRID been violated?

- A) No — email delivery is instantaneous
- B) Yes — the LE must be delivered within 3 business days of application
- C) No — Friday is within a reasonable timeframe
- D) Only if the APR differs from the final rate

**Answer: B** — Under TRID, the Loan Estimate must be **delivered** (not just sent) within **3 business days** of receiving a completed application. Day 1 = day after application. Delivering on day 4 is a violation.

---

**Scenario 17**
At closing, the borrower notices the origination fee on the Closing Disclosure is $300 more than on the Loan Estimate. The MLO says "a few costs changed." Is this acceptable?

- A) Yes — costs frequently change between LE and CD
- B) No — origination charges have a **0% tolerance** and cannot increase from the LE to the CD without a valid changed circumstance and revised LE
- C) Yes — as long as the total closing costs don't exceed 10% of the LE amount
- D) No — any cost increase requires a new loan application

**Answer: B** — Origination charges (lender fees) have zero tolerance under TRID. They cannot increase from LE to CD absent a valid changed circumstance that was disclosed in a revised LE.

---

**Scenario 18**
After issuing a Loan Estimate, the lender discovers the borrower's income is $15,000/year less than initially reported — a significant change that affects qualifying. Can the lender issue a revised Loan Estimate with changed fees?

- A) No — once the LE is issued, fees are locked
- B) Yes — a change in income is a valid changed circumstance that can trigger a revised LE
- C) Only if the borrower requests the revision in writing
- D) Only if the loan amount changes as a result

**Answer: B** — Discovery of new information about the borrower that was not known at the time of application (e.g., significantly different income) is a valid changed circumstance under TRID, allowing a revised LE.

---

**Scenario 19**
An MLO locks a borrower's rate on a conventional loan. Three days later, a hurricane is declared in the subject property's county, causing flood zone reclassification. Flood insurance is now required and costs $1,800/year — not anticipated in the original LE. Can the lender revise the LE?

- A) No — rate locks prevent any LE revisions
- B) Yes — an extraordinary event beyond anyone's control is a valid changed circumstance allowing an LE revision
- C) Only if the borrower agrees to waive the 3-business-day waiting period
- D) No — flood insurance is not a lender-required service and has no tolerance limit anyway

**Answer: B** — A natural disaster causing a flood zone reclassification is an extraordinary changed circumstance beyond anyone's control, allowing the lender to issue a revised LE.

---

**Scenario 20**
A borrower receives the Closing Disclosure on a Tuesday via email. They want to close on Friday. Assuming "business days" exclude Sundays, can they close on Friday?

- A) Yes — 3 business days from Tuesday: Wed, Thu, Fri
- B) No — they must wait until Monday (Saturday counts as a business day for TRID)
- C) Yes — if the borrower waives the waiting period in writing
- D) No — they must wait 5 business days

**Answer: B** — For TRID's 3-business-day waiting period after CD delivery, **Saturday counts as a business day** (federal public holidays do not). Tuesday delivery = Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday = 3 business days. Earliest closing = Monday.

---

**Scenario 21**
A borrower's lender credit increases from $500 on the LE to $800 on the CD. Is this permissible?

- A) No — lender credits cannot change between LE and CD
- B) Yes — increases in lender credits are permissible (they benefit the borrower)
- C) Only if a revised LE was issued first
- D) Only if the interest rate changed

**Answer: B** — Under TRID, lender credits that **increase** (i.e., the borrower gets more credit than disclosed) are permissible. Decreases in lender credits are not allowed without a valid changed circumstance.

---

**Scenario 22**
An MLO is doing a no-cost refinance. The borrower asks why the APR is so much higher than the note rate. The correct explanation is:

- A) The APR is a regulatory requirement and means nothing
- B) The APR includes the note rate plus finance charges (fees financed into the loan), spread over the loan term, giving a true annual cost of the loan
- C) The difference is the mortgage insurance premium only
- D) The APR is calculated incorrectly and should be disputed

**Answer: B** — In a no-cost refinance, fees are rolled into the rate (lender credits pay closing costs). The APR reflects this by incorporating those costs spread over the loan life, resulting in a higher APR than the note rate.

---

**Scenario 23**
A borrower wants to close on a purchase loan. The title search reveals an old mechanics lien on the property. The closing is delayed while the lien is resolved. The CD has already been delivered. Does the lender need to re-issue the CD?

- A) No — CD is only required once
- B) Only if the delay exceeds 7 days
- C) Yes — if the settlement date changes or if the CD contains inaccurate information, it may need to be re-disclosed
- D) No — the title company handles the lien and the CD is unaffected

**Answer: C** — If the closing date changes significantly and/or fees change as a result, an updated CD must be provided. The borrower must receive an accurate CD reflecting actual closing terms.

---

**Scenario 24**
The borrower selects a title company from the lender's written list of providers. The title fee quoted on the LE was $800. At closing, the fee is $900. Is this within TRID tolerances?

- A) No — services on the lender's list have 0% tolerance
- B) Yes — if the aggregate increase across all 10%-tolerance services doesn't exceed 10%
- C) Yes — title fees have unlimited tolerance
- D) No — any increase in title fees requires a lender credit

**Answer: B** — Services from the lender's list of providers fall in the **10% aggregate tolerance** category. The $100 increase is 12.5% — potentially a violation if other services in the same category also increased and the aggregate exceeds 10%.

---

**Scenario 25**
A borrower refinances. Three days after consummation, they call to rescind. The lender says the right of rescission doesn't apply because it was a cash-out refinance. Is the lender correct?

- A) Yes — cash-out refinances are exempt from rescission rights
- B) No — the right of rescission applies to ALL refinances of a primary residence, including cash-out refinances
- C) Yes — rescission only applies to HELOCs
- D) Only first-time homebuyers have a right of rescission

**Answer: B** — The right of rescission under TILA applies to any refinance transaction (including cash-out) on a borrower's **primary residence**. The lender is wrong.

---

**Scenario 26**
A borrower is closing on a VA loan. The lender charges a $1,500 "underwriting fee" not disclosed on the LE. Under TRID:

- A) This is acceptable — VA loans are exempt from TRID tolerances
- B) This is a violation — the undisclosed fee must be cured by the lender
- C) This is acceptable if the borrower signs a disclosure at closing
- D) This is acceptable because the VA funding fee is always added at closing

**Answer: B** — VA loans are subject to TRID. A new fee that wasn't on the LE and that exceeds the applicable tolerance must be cured by the lender (refund to the borrower within 60 calendar days after settlement).

---

**Scenario 27**
A borrower applies for a purchase loan. The MLO collects 5 of the 6 TRID application triggers (everything except the property address — borrower is still shopping). Is this a complete application requiring a Loan Estimate?

- A) Yes — 5 triggers are sufficient for a complete application
- B) No — all 6 triggers must be collected before the LE is required; the lender may issue a pre-approval letter instead
- C) Yes — the lender must issue an LE within 24 hours of collecting 5 triggers
- D) No — the lender needs the property address and purchase price before any disclosure

**Answer: B** — All **6 TRID application triggers** (name, income, SSN, property address, estimated value, loan amount) must be collected to constitute a complete application requiring an LE. Without the property address, no complete application exists.

---

## 🏠 SECTION C: Underwriting & Application Scenarios (Scenarios 28–39)

---

**Scenario 28**
A self-employed borrower provides 1 year of tax returns showing $85,000 net income. Conventional guidelines require 2 years of tax returns for self-employment income. The borrower says last year was an anomaly. What should the MLO do?

- A) Use the 1-year return since income looks strong
- B) Advise the borrower that conventional guidelines require 2 years; suggest FHA (which may also require 2 years) or portfolio lending
- C) Average 1 year of income and proceed
- D) Ask the borrower to provide a letter of explanation

**Answer: B** — Conventional (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac) guidelines require a **2-year history** of self-employment income. The MLO must advise the borrower of this requirement and explore alternatives — not circumvent the guidelines.

---

**Scenario 29**
An FHA loan appraisal comes back at value, but the appraiser notes the water heater is non-functional. FHA guidelines require all major mechanical systems to be operational. What happens?

- A) The loan can close — appraisal is complete
- B) The lender must escrow funds for the repair at closing
- C) The water heater must be repaired and the property re-inspected before the loan can close
- D) The borrower can sign a waiver accepting the defect

**Answer: C** — FHA appraisals are both an appraisal and a property condition review. FHA requires all mechanical systems (heating, plumbing, electrical, water heater) to be functional. The deficiency must be corrected and verified before loan approval/closing.

---

**Scenario 30**
A borrower's credit report shows a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged 2 years ago. They are applying for a conventional loan. Are they eligible?

- A) Yes — conventional loans have no bankruptcy waiting period
- B) No — conventional loans require a 7-year wait after Chapter 7
- C) No — Fannie Mae requires a 4-year waiting period after Chapter 7 discharge; they are only 2 years out
- D) Yes — as long as credit has been rebuilt to a 640+ score

**Answer: C** — Fannie Mae's standard waiting period for Chapter 7 bankruptcy is **4 years** from discharge (2 years with extenuating circumstances). At 2 years, this borrower does not yet qualify under standard guidelines.

---

**Scenario 31**
A borrower earns $60,000/year base salary plus $20,000 in overtime. The overtime has been received for 18 months. Can the MLO use the overtime income to qualify?

- A) Yes — any overtime currently being received counts
- B) No — overtime income is never considered in qualifying
- C) It depends — conventional guidelines typically require a 2-year history of overtime income to use it for qualifying; 18 months may or may not be acceptable depending on the lender and AUS
- D) Yes — but only 50% of the overtime income may be used

**Answer: C** — Overtime income typically requires a **2-year history** to be counted for qualifying under Fannie Mae guidelines. An 18-month history is close but may not meet standard guidelines; some lenders may accept it with additional documentation. The MLO must check lender overlays.

---

**Scenario 32**
A VA-eligible borrower is purchasing a home. The VA appraisal (Notice of Value) comes in $15,000 below the purchase price. The seller will not reduce the price. What are the borrower's options?

- A) The loan must be denied — the VA will not allow above-appraised-value loans
- B) The borrower can pay the difference between the appraised value and purchase price in cash (VA "escape clause" protects the borrower from being forced to buy)
- C) The seller must reduce the price to appraised value by law
- D) The lender can make up the difference with a seller concession

**Answer: B** — VA loans include a "VA escape clause" that allows the veteran to walk away from the contract if the appraisal comes in low. However, if the veteran wishes to proceed, they may pay the price difference in cash — but they cannot finance the gap. The seller is not legally required to reduce the price.

---

**Scenario 33**
A borrower has $100,000 in a 401(k). They want to count it as reserves for a conventional loan. The underwriter counts 60% of the vested balance. Why?

- A) The IRS requires a 40% withholding on all 401(k) withdrawals
- B) Early withdrawal from retirement accounts typically incurs a 10% penalty plus income tax, so only 60% of the vested balance is counted as accessible funds
- C) Conventional guidelines prohibit using retirement accounts as reserves
- D) The 40% discount represents market risk in the investment

**Answer: B** — Fannie Mae guidelines allow retirement accounts as reserves but apply a **60% haircut** to account for taxes and early withdrawal penalties that would reduce available funds if liquidated.

---

**Scenario 34**
A borrower's monthly gross income is $7,500. Their PITI is $1,800, car payment is $450, and minimum credit card payments total $300. What is their back-end DTI?

- A) 24%
- B) 34%
- C) 40%
- D) 44%

**Answer: B** — Back-end DTI = (PITI + all recurring debts) ÷ gross income = ($1,800 + $450 + $300) ÷ $7,500 = $2,550 ÷ $7,500 = **34%**.

---

**Scenario 35**
A borrower's spouse is not on the loan application. During processing, the underwriter pulls the spouse's credit report (in a community property state) to check for liabilities. The borrower did not authorize this. Is this permissible?

- A) No — pulling any credit without consent is an FCRA violation
- B) Yes — in community property states, the non-applicant spouse's debts may be community obligations; lenders may be required to review them
- C) No — spouses are never included in mortgage underwriting without consent
- D) Yes — as long as it's not used in the credit decision

**Answer: B** — In community property states (AZ, CA, ID, LA, NV, NM, TX, WA, WI), marital debts may be community obligations. Fannie Mae and FHA guidelines allow/require the non-borrowing spouse's liabilities to be reviewed, even if their income and credit score are not used in qualifying.

---

**Scenario 36**
A borrower is using a $30,000 gift from their parents for their FHA down payment. What documentation is required?

- A) A signed gift letter only
- B) A gift letter plus documentation showing the transfer of funds (bank statement or wire confirmation showing the debit from donor and credit to borrower)
- C) A gift letter, 2 months of donor's bank statements, and a notarized affidavit
- D) Nothing — gifts are treated as assets at face value

**Answer: B** — FHA requires a **gift letter** (stating the amount, relationship, and that no repayment is expected) **plus documentation** of the transfer (evidence funds left the donor's account and arrived in the borrower's account).

---

**Scenario 37**
An underwriter issues a "Suspend" decision on a file. What does this mean?

- A) The loan is approved but closing is delayed
- B) The file is missing required information; the underwriter cannot make a decision until the borrower provides it
- C) The loan is denied pending a HUD review
- D) The borrower's income documentation was fraudulent

**Answer: B** — A "Suspend" or "Incomplete" underwriting decision means the underwriter cannot make a credit decision because required documentation is missing. It is not a denial. The file is returned with conditions for additional information.

---

**Scenario 38**
A borrower has had 3 late payments in the past 12 months. An FHA loan requires no more than 1 late payment in the past 12 months. The underwriter denies the loan. The borrower asks the MLO to submit to a different lender with "easier guidelines." The MLO should:

- A) Submit to multiple lenders simultaneously to find one that will approve the loan
- B) Explain that FHA guidelines are set by HUD and apply universally; suggest working on credit improvement
- C) Remove one late payment from the credit report and resubmit
- D) Submit as a conventional loan to avoid FHA requirements

**Answer: B** — FHA credit guidelines are set by HUD and apply to all FHA lenders. The MLO should honestly advise the borrower of their options — credit improvement, alternative loan programs, or portfolio lenders — without misrepresenting guidelines or manipulating the file.

---

**Scenario 39**
A borrower is purchasing a home with 5% down. The loan-to-value (LTV) is 95%. The lender requires PMI. The borrower asks how PMI can be removed. The correct answer includes:

- A) PMI is permanent on conventional loans
- B) PMI can be cancelled when the LTV reaches 80% based on original value; it must be automatically terminated at 78% LTV per the Homeowners Protection Act
- C) PMI is removed when the credit score reaches 740
- D) PMI requires a $5,000 lump-sum payment to terminate early

**Answer: B** — Under the Homeowners Protection Act (HPA): borrower can **request** cancellation at 80% LTV (based on original value), lender must **automatically terminate** at 78% LTV (per original amortization), and PMI must terminate at the midpoint of the loan term in all cases.

---

## ⚖️ SECTION D: Ethics & Fraud Scenarios (Scenarios 40–50)

---

**Scenario 40**
An MLO helps a borrower purchase an investment property. The borrower asks the MLO to list it as a "primary residence" on the application to get a lower rate. The MLO agrees and signs off on the file. This is:

- A) Acceptable if the borrower intends to live there eventually
- B) Occupancy fraud — a federal crime involving mortgage fraud
- C) Acceptable if disclosed to the lender in a separate letter
- D) A RESPA violation — occupancy type is a settlement service

**Answer: B** — Falsely stating occupancy on a mortgage application is **occupancy fraud**, a form of mortgage fraud punishable under 18 U.S.C. § 1014. Both the borrower AND the MLO face federal criminal liability.

---

**Scenario 41**
A borrower shows the MLO pay stubs that appear professionally formatted, but the employer's phone number goes to a personal cell phone and the address returns a vacant lot on Google Maps. What should the MLO do?

- A) Accept the documents — document review is the underwriter's job
- B) Flag the discrepancies as income fraud red flags and escalate to compliance; do not proceed with the application as-is
- C) Call the "employer" and accept the verbal confirmation
- D) Submit the file and note the discrepancies in an addendum

**Answer: B** — Inconsistencies in employment documentation (fake phone number, no physical address) are income/employment fraud red flags. The MLO has a duty to escalate — not to turn a blind eye. Submitting a file knowing it may contain fraudulent documents is a crime.

---

**Scenario 42**
An appraiser calls an MLO before completing an appraisal and asks, "The sales price is $350,000 — should I be near that number?" The MLO responds: "We really need it to come in at value for this deal to work." This exchange:

- A) Is a normal business communication — the MLO is just being informative
- B) Violates Appraisal Independence Requirements (AIR) — the MLO is applying pressure to influence the appraisal
- C) Is acceptable since the MLO didn't specify a number
- D) Violates RESPA but not TILA

**Answer: B** — AIR requirements (and FIRREA) prohibit anyone with an interest in the transaction from attempting to influence an appraiser's determination of value. "We need it to come in at value" is improper pressure regardless of how subtle.

---

**Scenario 43**
An MLO closes 30 loans per month. Their manager says to always recommend the 30-year fixed over the ARM because "the margin is higher." The MLO knows several borrowers would benefit financially from an ARM. The MLO's ethical obligation is to:

- A) Follow the manager's direction — they are the authority
- B) Recommend the loan product that best fits each individual borrower's needs, not the one with the highest margin
- C) Offer both products and let the borrower choose with no guidance
- D) Document the manager's instruction in the file to protect themselves

**Answer: B** — MLOs have an ethical and legal duty to recommend loan products in the borrower's best interest. Steering borrowers based on MLO profit rather than borrower suitability violates the LO Compensation Rule and anti-steering provisions of Dodd-Frank.

---

**Scenario 44**
A borrower asks an MLO to submit their application to 5 different lenders simultaneously without disclosing this to any of the lenders. This practice is known as:

- A) Rate shopping — fully legal and encouraged
- B) Loan stacking — submitting the same application to multiple lenders to obtain multiple approvals and potentially multiple loans simultaneously; it's a form of fraud
- C) Application hedging — an industry-accepted practice
- D) Pre-qualification — no formal applications are submitted

**Answer: B** — **Loan stacking** is fraudulent. Submitting the same application to multiple lenders to obtain simultaneous approvals (and potentially draw on multiple loan proceeds) is mortgage fraud. Rate shopping (getting quotes or pre-approvals disclosed to all parties) is legitimate.

---

**Scenario 45**
An MLO provides a borrower with a written quote showing 5.75% with no origination fee. At closing, the rate is 6.125% and there's a $1,500 origination fee, with a different explanation. The borrower never agreed to the change. This is:

- A) A standard rate fluctuation — rates change
- B) Bait and switch — advertising favorable terms to attract customers, then switching to unfavorable terms at closing
- C) Acceptable if the new terms are within TRID tolerances
- D) Only a problem if the CD was not delivered 3 days before closing

**Answer: B** — **Bait and switch** is an unfair and deceptive practice (UDAAP violation). Offering terms to attract a borrower then changing them without consent — especially at the closing table when the borrower has limited options — is both unethical and potentially illegal.

---

**Scenario 46**
An MLO's borrower is about to close on a purchase. The MLO learns the borrower's employer just announced mass layoffs, but the borrower hasn't been notified yet. The MLO knows this information informally. What should the MLO do?

- A) Proceed — layoff hasn't happened yet
- B) Inform the lender and allow them to verify current employment before funding, per standard lender practice
- C) Coach the borrower to call in sick on closing day to avoid a final VOE
- D) Tell the borrower to find a new job and reapply in 60 days

**Answer: B** — Lenders typically verify employment immediately before funding. The MLO has a duty to ensure the loan file remains accurate. Coaching a borrower to circumvent verification is fraud; proceeding with known material information that could affect eligibility is also problematic. Disclosure to the lender is the correct path.

---

**Scenario 47**
A friend of an MLO asks the MLO to qualify them for a loan. The friend does not meet the income requirements. The MLO submits the file anyway, inflating the stated income, hoping the AUS "approves it anyway." This is:

- A) Acceptable — the AUS makes the final decision, not the MLO
- B) Income fraud — knowingly submitting inaccurate income data on a mortgage application is a federal crime
- C) Acceptable if the MLO includes a letter of explanation
- D) A minor compliance issue — not criminal

**Answer: B** — Knowingly falsifying income on a mortgage application violates **18 U.S.C. § 1014** (false statements to federally insured lenders). Both the MLO and the borrower face federal criminal liability. An AUS approval based on fraudulent data does not immunize the parties.

---

**Scenario 48**
An MLO is licensed in Florida and moves to Georgia. They continue to take loan applications for Georgia properties using only their Florida license. After 90 days, they apply for a Georgia license. Which statement is true?

- A) This is acceptable because most NMLS licenses are multistate
- B) This violates the SAFE Act — originating loans in a state without an active license is unlicensed mortgage activity
- C) This is acceptable during a 90-day transitional period
- D) Only applies if the loans fund; taking applications is not regulated

**Answer: B** — Originating residential mortgage loans in a state without an active, valid license for that state is a violation of the SAFE Act and the relevant state's mortgage licensing laws. Taking applications counts as originating.

---

**Scenario 49**
An MLO receives a $500 gift card from a real estate agent at Christmas — not tied to any specific transaction. Under RESPA, this:

- A) Is clearly a RESPA violation — no gifts are allowed from real estate agents
- B) May be acceptable as a normal business courtesy if it is not part of a referral arrangement; but gifts of significant value exchanged with referral partners carry RESPA §8 risk
- C) Violates RESPA Section 9
- D) Is only a problem if the MLO gives the agent something in return

**Answer: B** — RESPA §8 prohibits things of value given as part of a referral arrangement. A holiday gift card from a referral source is in a gray area. $500 is a significant value — regulators look at whether there is a pattern of gifts tied to referral volume. The MLO should be cautious and know their company's gift policy.

---

**Scenario 50**
A borrower's file shows they are applying for 3 investment properties simultaneously. None of the applications reference the other properties or the combined debt obligation. The MLO is aware of all 3 applications. What is the MLO's obligation?

- A) Process each file independently — borrowers are entitled to privacy
- B) Ensure all liabilities (including the other pending loans/properties) are properly disclosed and included in the debt analysis on each file
- C) Deny two of the applications since investment properties are limited
- D) Advise the borrower to apply for only one at a time

**Answer: B** — Concealing liabilities (including pending mortgage applications) from lenders is a form of mortgage fraud. The MLO has a duty to ensure all material liabilities are disclosed. Submitting files that omit known pending liabilities is a fraud red flag.

## 🪪 SECTION E: State Licensing Scenarios (Scenarios 51–60)

---

**Scenario 51**
An MLO passes the SAFE exam and completes all pre-licensing education. They begin originating loans before receiving their state license approval. This is:

- A) Acceptable — completing requirements is sufficient to originate
- B) A SAFE Act violation — originating loans before license approval is unlicensed mortgage activity
- C) Acceptable for 30 days under a provisional license
- D) Acceptable only for their home state

**Answer: B** — An MLO must have an **approved, active license** before originating mortgage loans. Beginning to originate while the application is pending (absent transitional authority) is a violation of state licensing laws and the SAFE Act.

---

**Scenario 52**
An MLO's license is set to expire December 31. They complete their CE on December 28 but do not submit the renewal application until January 5. What is the status of their license?

- A) Still active — CE completion is what matters
- B) Lapsed — the renewal application and fees must be submitted by the deadline; CE alone does not renew the license
- C) On probationary status until renewal is processed
- D) Active for 30 days after expiration under a grace period

**Answer: B** — Most states require both **CE completion AND timely submission of the renewal application (with fees)** by the deadline. CE alone does not renew the license. If the application is submitted after the expiration date, the license lapses.

---

**Scenario 53**
An MLO changes employers. At the new company, the compliance manager tells the MLO to start originating loans right away since "NMLS updates take a few days." The MLO should:

- A) Start immediately — employer changes are administrative
- B) Wait until the new employer's sponsorship is reflected as active on NMLS; originating before that puts the license in inactive status
- C) Get a verbal confirmation from the state regulator before starting
- D) Originate in the new employer's name with a retroactive NMLS update

**Answer: B** — An MLO's license is only **active** when properly sponsored by their employing entity on NMLS. Originating before the sponsorship is active means originating without an active license.

---

**Scenario 54**
An MLO is named in a civil lawsuit alleging mortgage misrepresentation. This happened 60 days ago. The MLO hasn't updated their NMLS record. What should they do immediately?

- A) Nothing — civil lawsuits are not reportable until resolved
- B) Amend their NMLS record to disclose the lawsuit — most states require disclosure of material legal/regulatory actions within 30 days
- C) Report it only if a judgment is entered against them
- D) Ask their employer to report it on their behalf

**Answer: B** — Most state licensing requirements (and the NMLS MU4 form) require disclosure of civil lawsuits related to financial services activity within **30 days**. The MLO is already past the deadline and should amend immediately.

---

**Scenario 55**
A state licensing authority denies an MLO's application due to a 10-year-old felony drug conviction. The MLO argues they've been rehabilitated and have a clean record since. What is generally true about this situation?

- A) A 10-year-old drug felony is automatically waived under the SAFE Act
- B) The SAFE Act permanently disqualifies any drug felony; there are no exceptions
- C) Drug-related felonies within 7 years of application are an automatic bar under the SAFE Act; a 10-year-old conviction may be considered by the state under a broader fitness review, but rehabilitation factors may be considered
- D) The applicant may bypass the state and apply for a federal exemption

**Answer: C** — The SAFE Act creates automatic bars for drug felonies **within the past 7 years**. A 10-year-old conviction is not an automatic bar, but states can still deny based on character and fitness. Some states conduct individualized reviews considering rehabilitation.

---

**Scenario 56**
An MLO wants to also work as a real estate agent. Which of the following is most important to know?

- A) It is always prohibited to hold both an MLO license and a real estate license
- B) Some states permit dual licensing with conditions; others prohibit it. RESPA concerns arise if the MLO refers clients to themselves as a real estate agent
- C) RESPA explicitly permits MLO/real estate agent dual roles
- D) Dual licensing is only allowed for MLOs at banks

**Answer: B** — Dual licensing rules vary by state. Even where permitted, an MLO who is also the buyer's agent and originates their own loan creates serious **RESPA §8 conflict of interest issues**, particularly regarding kickbacks and referral fees.

---

**Scenario 57**
An MLO in state X wants to originate a loan for a borrower buying property in state Y, where the MLO is not licensed. The MLO's company is licensed in state Y. Can the MLO originate the loan?

- A) Yes — the company's license covers all its employees
- B) No — MLO licenses are individual; the MLO personally must be licensed in state Y to originate loans in state Y
- C) Yes — as long as the borrower is a resident of state X
- D) Yes — if state Y has a reciprocity agreement with state X

**Answer: B** — Under the SAFE Act, **each individual MLO** must be licensed in the state where the subject property is located (or where the borrower resides, depending on state law). The company license does not cover unlicensed employees.

---

**Scenario 58**
An MLO completes 6 of the required 8 CE hours. Can they renew their license?

- A) Yes — 6 hours shows good faith effort
- B) No — all 8 required CE hours must be completed to renew; partial completion does not satisfy the requirement
- C) Yes — they can make up the remaining hours in the first quarter of the next year
- D) Yes — if the 6 hours cover the mandatory topics (federal law and ethics)

**Answer: B** — CE requirements must be fully satisfied (**all 8 hours**) before license renewal. There is no partial credit or grace period to complete the remaining hours after the fact.

---

**Scenario 59**
An MLO's license is revoked in State A for fraud. They apply for a new license in State B. On the NMLS application, they do not disclose the State A revocation. What are the consequences?

- A) The State B license may be approved since states don't share information
- B) The application itself is fraudulent — NMLS records are national, the revocation is visible, and intentional omission on an NMLS application is grounds for immediate denial and potentially criminal charges
- C) The MLO must wait 1 year after revocation before applying in another state
- D) Only the date of revocation matters; omitting it is a minor administrative error

**Answer: B** — NMLS records are **national and public**. A revocation in any state is visible to all state regulators. Intentionally failing to disclose a prior license action is a **material misrepresentation** on a licensing application — grounds for denial in State B and potentially criminal fraud charges.

---

**Scenario 60**
An MLO is offered a high-paying position at a company under federal investigation for predatory lending practices. The MLO's name is not involved in the investigation. Should the MLO have any concern before joining?

- A) No — the investigation involves the company, not the individual
- B) Yes — knowingly working for a company engaged in predatory lending could implicate the MLO; conducting due diligence before joining is prudent
- C) No — the MLO is protected as long as they don't participate in the specific loans under investigation
- D) Only if the company is already under a consent order

**Answer: B** — An MLO who knowingly participates in a company's predatory lending activities — even if they originate loans they believe are clean — can be implicated in a broader enforcement action. Due diligence before joining a company under investigation is both practical and ethically required.
