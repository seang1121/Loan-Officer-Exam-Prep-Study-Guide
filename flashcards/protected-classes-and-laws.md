## THE COMPLETE PROTECTED CLASS COMPARISON

## FAIR HOUSING ACT EXEMPTIONS

**Know These Cold — The Exam Loves to Test These:**

| Exemption | Condition | Exception to Exemption |
|---|---|---|
| **Private seller selling own SFR** | Seller owns and sells 1-4 single-family homes; no real estate broker used; no discriminatory advertising | Race/color CANNOT be excluded (Civil Rights Act of 1866) |
| **Mrs. Murphy exemption** | Owner-occupied building of 4 or fewer units; owner lives in one unit | Must not use discriminatory advertising |
| **Religious organizations** | Can give preference to members for housing owned by the org | Cannot restrict based on race/color |
| **Private clubs** | Can give preference to members for housing they own as incidental to their non-commercial purpose | Cannot restrict based on race/color |

> ⚡ **Key Rule:** There is NO exemption for race or color. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. § 1982) covers all races with absolutely no exemptions, even for private sales.

## EXAM TRAP SCENARIOS

**Scenario 1:**
A borrower applies for a mortgage. The loan officer asks the borrower's age to make sure they're old enough to sign contracts. Is this a violation?

**Answer: No.** ECOA allows asking age to verify the borrower is of legal age to enter a contract. What's prohibited is using age to DENY credit (e.g., "We don't lend to people over 70").

---

**Scenario 2:**
A lender asks a female applicant if she is pregnant or plans to have children. Is this a violation?

**Answer: Yes.** This is a prohibited ECOA inquiry — it suggests the lender might use family planning to discriminate based on sex or familial status.

---

**Scenario 3:**
A church owns an apartment building and gives preference to members of the congregation when renting units. Is this a Fair Housing violation?

**Answer: No — with an important caveat.** Religious organizations are exempt from the Fair Housing Act for housing they own, allowing them to give preference to members. HOWEVER, they still cannot discriminate based on race or color.

---

**Scenario 4:**
A real estate agent shows homes only in certain neighborhoods to families based on race. Is this a violation?

**Answer: Yes — Steering.** Steering — directing buyers to or away from neighborhoods based on a protected class — violates the Fair Housing Act. This applies regardless of whether the homes shown are "nice" or not.

---

**Scenario 5:**
A lender's minimum loan amount is $100,000. Studies show that property values in predominantly minority neighborhoods rarely exceed $75,000. Is this discrimination?

**Answer: Likely Yes — Disparate Impact.** The policy is facially neutral but has a disproportionate negative impact on minority borrowers. This could constitute disparate impact discrimination under the Fair Housing Act and ECOA.

---

**Scenario 6:**
A lender denies a mortgage application because the borrower receives Social Security Disability Income. What law(s) could be violated?

**Answer: Both Fair Housing Act and ECOA.** Fair Housing: Disability is a protected class. ECOA: The lender cannot refuse to consider income from public assistance sources. The borrower should not be denied solely because their income source is disability.

---

**Scenario 7:**
A homeowner sells his house himself (no agent) and refuses to sell to a Black family. Has he violated any law?

**Answer: Yes — Civil Rights Act of 1866.** While the Fair Housing Act has a private seller exemption, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. § 1982) prohibits racial discrimination in property transactions with NO exemptions. There is no private seller exemption for race or color.

---

**Scenario 8:**
An MLO charges Hispanic borrowers 0.5% more in origination fees than similarly-qualified white borrowers. Which type of discrimination is this?

**Answer: Disparate Treatment.** This is intentional differential treatment based on national origin/race — the definition of disparate treatment (intentional discrimination).

---

**Scenario 9:**
A lender's policy requires a minimum two-year employment history. A recent college graduate is denied. Is this a protected class issue?

**Answer: Unlikely.** Age and recent graduation are not protected classes in lending (ECOA protects against denial due to age, but requiring employment history is a legitimate underwriting standard). No protected class is being targeted — the policy applies equally to all recent graduates regardless of protected class.

---

**Scenario 10:**
A bank refuses to make loans for properties in a low-income neighborhood. What type of discrimination is this most likely?

**Answer: Redlining / Possible Disparate Impact.** Refusing to lend in specific geographic areas (especially if those areas are predominantly minority) is redlining — a classic Fair Housing and ECOA violation. It could also trigger CRA concerns for federally regulated banks.
