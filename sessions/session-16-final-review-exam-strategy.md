### SECTION C: LAST-MINUTE MNEMONICS

**Fair Housing 7 Protected Classes:**
**"RANCH FD"** → NO — actually:
**"Race, Color, Religion, National Origin, Sex, Familial Status, Disability/Handicap"**

Better: Just say **"FARNISH C"** = Familial, [mArital NOT here], Race, National origin, [age NOT here], Sex, Handicap, Color

Or simply: **R-C-R-N-S-F-H** (Race, Color, Religion, National origin, Sex, Familial status, Handicap)

---

**ECOA adds to Fair Housing:** A-M-P-C (Age, Marital status, Public assistance, Consumer credit protection act rights)

---

**The 3-7-3 TRID Rule:**
- **3** days: Send LE after application
- **7** days: Minimum wait before closing
- **3** days: Send CD before closing

---

**"30 Days for Everything Else":**
- ECOA adverse action notice
- SAR filing
- FCRA credit dispute investigation
- MLO self-reporting changes
- All 30 days!

---

**ATR 8 Factors — "ICPM + MCDCT":**
- **I**ncome/assets
- **C**urrent employment
- **P**ayment on subject loan
- **M**ortgage-related obligations
- **S**imultaneous loans
- **D**ebt obligations/alimony/child support
- **D**TI/residual income
- **C**redit history

(Or just: "8 factors = everything an underwriter looks at to see if you can pay")

---

**GSE Memory Trick:**
- **FanniE** = **F-N-M-A** = **D**esktop **U**nderwriter (DU) = buy conventional
- **FreddiE** = **F-H-L-M-C** = **L**oan **P**roduct **A**dvisor (LPA) = buy conventional
- **GinniE** = **G-N-M-A** = **G**uarantees only, doesn't buy = government loans (FHA/VA/USDA)

---

**Deed Protection Level:**
General > Special > Bargain & Sale > Quitclaim
(Strongest to weakest protection for the buyer)

---

### SECTION D: COMMON EXAM TRAPS

**Trap 1 — Fair Housing vs. ECOA Class Overlap**
- "Which classes does ECOA ADD to Fair Housing?"
- Answer: Age, Marital Status, Public Assistance, CCPA rights
- Trap: "Does age appear in Fair Housing?" NO — age is ECOA only

**Trap 2 — Right of Rescission**
- Applies to REFINANCES on primary residence, NOT purchases
- If the question says "purchase transaction" — no rescission
- If it says "refinance of primary residence" — 3-day rescission applies

**Trap 3 — Zero vs. 10% Tolerance**
- Credit report fee = Zero tolerance (required, lender selects)
- Recording fee = 10% tolerance
- Homeowner's insurance = Unlimited (borrower selects)

**Trap 4 — Ginnie Mae Does NOT Buy Loans**
- "Which GSE purchases FHA loans?" → NONE (Ginnie Mae guarantees the MBS, doesn't buy)

**Trap 5 — FHA MIP Duration**
- <10% down = MIP FOREVER
- 10%+ down = MIP cancels after 11 years
- Conventional PMI cancels at 78% LTV automatically

**Trap 6 — HOEPA vs. HPML Thresholds**
- HPML = Lower thresholds (more loans caught: 1.5%/3.5%)
- HOEPA = Higher thresholds (fewer, worst loans: 6.5%/8.5%)
- Don't flip the numbers!

**Trap 7 — Bank vs. Non-Bank Licensing**
- Bank MLOs REGISTER with NMLS (don't get licensed)
- Non-bank MLOs get LICENSED by the state
- Both get an NMLS ID number

**Trap 8 — CTR vs. SAR**
- CTR: Cash >$10,000 = file within 15 days (mandatory regardless of suspicion)
- SAR: Suspicious activity ≥$5,000 = file within 30 days (involves judgment)

**Trap 9 — Business Day Definition in TRID**
- For 3-day LE delivery: "General business day" (lender's business hours)
- For 7-day waiting period and 3-day CD: "Specific business day" (all days except Sundays and federal holidays — SATURDAYS COUNT)

**Trap 10 — DTI and QM**
- General QM cap: 43% back-end DTI
- FHA allows higher (up to 57% with compensating factors)
- VA uses residual income, not strict DTI cap

---

### SECTION E: EXAM DAY STRATEGY

**Time Management:**
- 125 questions / 190 minutes = **1.52 minutes per question**
- 25 questions are unscored pre-test items (you don't know which ones)
- Only 100 questions are actually graded
- Pace yourself: Check time at question 30, 60, 90 — you should have used ~45, 90, 135 minutes

**The Flag-and-Return Method:**
1. Read the question
2. If you know it: Answer it and move on
3. If unsure: Make your best guess, **FLAG** it, move on (don't leave blank)
4. After finishing all questions: Return to flagged items with remaining time

> ⚡ Never leave a question blank — there's no penalty for guessing.

**Elimination Strategy:**
- Usually, 1-2 answers are clearly wrong — eliminate them immediately
- This gives you 50/50 odds at minimum
- On "which is NOT" questions: Find the 3 that ARE correct, the remaining one is your answer

**Reading Strategy:**
- Read the question stem first, then the answer choices
- Watch for qualifiers: "ALWAYS," "NEVER," "most likely," "could," "required"
- "Most commonly tested" scenarios: federal law numbers, timelines, protected classes

**Common Question Types:**
1. **"What law governs X?"** → Know the law-to-subject mapping
2. **"Which is required within X days?"** → Know all timelines cold
3. **"MLO does X — is this a violation?"** → Identify the regulation and apply it
4. **"Borrower has Y situation — which loan type?"** → Know eligibility for FHA/VA/USDA/conventional
5. **"What is the protected class under X law?"** → Know ECOA vs. Fair Housing

---

## 🏆 PART 2: TOP 25 HARDEST QUESTIONS (WITH EXPLANATIONS)

**1. A borrower with no credit score wants an FHA loan. What happens?**
A) Automatic denial
B) Manual underwriting is available for non-traditional credit
C) Must use conventional
D) Can use USDA instead

**Answer: B.** FHA allows manual underwriting for borrowers with no credit score using non-traditional credit histories (rent payments, utilities, insurance payments).

---

**2. Which of the following would NOT trigger a new 3-day waiting period after a Closing Disclosure?**
A) APR decreases by 0.5%
B) APR increases by 0.2%
C) Loan product changes from fixed to ARM
D) Prepayment penalty is added

**Answer: A.** An APR DECREASE does not restart the clock. Triggers: APR increase > 0.125%, product change, prepayment penalty added.

---

**3. A lender makes a HOEPA loan and includes a prepayment penalty. This is:**
A) Legal if the penalty doesn't exceed 2% of the prepaid amount
B) Legal for the first 3 years only
C) Prohibited on all HOEPA loans
D) Legal with a written waiver from the borrower

**Answer: C.** Post-Dodd-Frank, prepayment penalties are completely prohibited on all HOEPA (high-cost) loans.

---

**4. An appraiser values a home at $275,000. The sales price is $300,000. The borrower wants to put 5% down. How much must the borrower put down?**
A) $15,000 (5% of sales price)
B) $25,000 (the appraisal gap + enough for 5% LTV)
C) $25,000 (5% of appraised value + appraisal gap)
D) $38,750 (enough to bring LTV to 80%)

**Answer: C (approximately).** LTV is based on the lower of sales price or appraised value ($275,000). 5% of $275,000 = $13,750 minimum down payment (for a 95% LTV loan). But the loan can only be 95% of $275,000 = $261,250. Purchase price is $300,000. So buyer must pay: $300,000 - $261,250 = $38,750. This covers the LTV requirement plus the appraisal gap.

> This is a common calculation trap. The loan is limited to 95% of the LOWER value ($275K), so buyer must make up the difference from their own funds.

---

**5. An MLO can be compensated by both the lender and the borrower in the same transaction when:**
A) The borrower consents in writing
B) The total compensation doesn't exceed 3% of the loan
C) Never — dual compensation is prohibited
D) The borrower's compensation is in the form of points

**Answer: C.** The LO Compensation Rule prohibits dual compensation — an MLO cannot receive payment from both the lender and borrower in the same transaction.

---

**6. A person asks an MLO to pull their neighbor's credit to see if they're a good credit risk before entering into a business deal. The MLO does so. What law is violated?**
A) ECOA
B) FCRA
C) HMDA
D) BSA

**Answer: B.** Pulling a credit report without a permissible purpose violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). "Business deal with neighbor" is not a permissible purpose.

---

**7. A HECM becomes due and payable when:**
A) The borrower turns 80
B) The borrower fails to make monthly payments
C) The borrower lives in a nursing facility for 11 months
D) The property is damaged by a storm

**Answer: C.** A HECM becomes due when the borrower is absent from the property for 12 consecutive months (not 11 months — at 11 months they're still under the threshold). Other triggers: death, sale, failure to maintain taxes/insurance/property. Choice C says 11 months which is NOT yet triggering — the answer should be "none of the above would trigger it yet." In a real exam, the answer would typically be phrased correctly. For our purposes: HECM triggers = death, sale, 12+ month absence, or failure to maintain taxes/insurance.

---

**8. Recording fees are in which TRID tolerance category?**
A) Zero tolerance
B) 10% tolerance
C) Unlimited tolerance
D) Not subject to tolerance requirements

**Answer: B.** Recording fees are in the 10% tolerance category. This surprises many people who think government fees should be zero tolerance — but recording fees can vary and have a 10% wiggle room.

---

**9. A bank with $6 billion in assets is directly supervised by the CFPB. True or False?**
A) True
B) False — the CFPB only supervises banks with $10 billion+ in assets

**Answer: B.** The CFPB directly supervises banks with $10 billion or more in assets. Banks under $10 billion are supervised by their primary federal regulator (OCC, FDIC, or Fed Reserve). However, ALL non-bank mortgage companies are supervised by CFPB regardless of size.

---

**10. Which of the following is an example of disparate impact?**
A) An MLO charges higher fees to Hispanic borrowers intentionally
B) A lender requires English-only loan documents, which disadvantages non-English speakers
C) An MLO steers minority borrowers to high-cost products
D) A lender redlines a minority neighborhood

**Answer: B.** English-only documents is a facially neutral policy that has a disparate impact on non-English-speaking borrowers. No discriminatory intent is needed for disparate impact. Options A, C, D involve intentional discrimination (disparate treatment).

---

**11. A borrower wants to use a VA loan on a second home. Can she?**
A) Yes — VA loans have no restrictions on property type
B) No — VA loans are for primary residences only
C) Yes — if it's in the same city as her primary residence
D) No — VA loans can only be used once

**Answer: B.** VA loans are for primary residences only. The borrower must intend to occupy the property as their primary home. Second homes, investment properties, and vacation homes are not eligible for VA financing.

---

**12. An MLO fails to deliver the Loan Estimate within 3 business days of receiving a complete application. This is a violation of:**
A) ECOA
B) RESPA/TRID (Regulation X)
C) FCRA
D) HMDA

**Answer: B.** The TRID rules requiring the LE within 3 business days of a complete application are implemented under RESPA and TILA through Regulation X and Regulation Z (collectively, TRID). Violation = potential fine and enforcement action.

---

**13. Under HMDA, a lender that denies a loan must report which "action taken" code?**
A) 1
B) 2
C) 3
D) 4

**Answer: C.** HMDA Action Taken Code 3 = Application Denied. Code 1 = Originated; Code 2 = Approved not accepted; Code 4 = Withdrawn.

---

**14. A borrower's Chapter 7 was discharged 3.5 years ago. They want a conventional mortgage. Are they eligible?**
A) Yes — they've waited over 2 years
B) No — they need to wait 4 years from discharge
C) Yes — if they have a 620+ credit score
D) Yes — with 20% down payment

**Answer: B.** Conventional loans require a 4-year waiting period from Chapter 7 discharge. At 3.5 years, the borrower is not yet eligible regardless of credit score or down payment.

---

**15. Which of the following is TRUE about Ginnie Mae (GNMA)?**
A) It purchases conventional conforming loans from lenders
B) It is regulated by FHFA
C) It guarantees mortgage-backed securities backed by FHA, VA, and USDA loans
D) It competes directly with Fannie Mae for loan purchases

**Answer: C.** Ginnie Mae guarantees (not purchases) MBS backed by government loans (FHA, VA, USDA). It is part of HUD, not regulated by FHFA. It does not purchase loans and doesn't compete with Fannie/Freddie.

---

**16. A MLO is telling a borrower they can lower their rate by 0.25% per point. The loan amount is $450,000 and the note rate is 6.75%. If the borrower wants a 6.25% rate, how many points must they buy and what does it cost?**
A) 1 point, $4,500
B) 2 points, $9,000
C) 2 points, $4,500
D) 4 points, $18,000

**Answer: B.** To go from 6.75% to 6.25% = reduce by 0.50%. At 0.25% per point, need 2 points. 2 points × 1% × $450,000 = $9,000.

---

**17. A real estate agent receives a computer worth $500 from a title company that she routinely refers clients to. This is:**
A) Legal if disclosed on the Closing Disclosure
B) Legal because it's under $1,000
C) A RESPA Section 8 violation
D) Legal if there is an AfBA disclosure

**Answer: C.** RESPA §8 prohibits giving or receiving anything of value for referrals of settlement service business. There is no dollar minimum — even $1 is prohibited. An AfBA disclosure allows the REFERRAL but doesn't allow kickbacks — the agent must have an actual ownership interest and the AfBA rules require more than just a disclosure.

---

**18. Under ECOA, a lender must give the applicant specific reasons for denial or inform them of their right to request reasons within:**
A) 30 days
B) 45 days
C) 60 days
D) 90 days

**Answer: C.** Under ECOA, if the adverse action notice doesn't include specific reasons, it must tell the applicant of their right to request the specific reasons. The applicant then has **60 days** to make that request.

---

**19. A lender uses a policy that awards bonus points toward mortgage approval for applicants who graduate from certain universities. This could be a:**
A) Legitimate business practice if consistently applied
B) Disparate impact problem if those universities have predominantly one racial demographic
C) Fair Housing violation only
D) Not a lending concern since it's an academic credential

**Answer: B.** A facially neutral policy (graduation from specific schools) that has a disproportionate impact on a protected class (if the schools are predominantly one race) could constitute disparate impact discrimination. The fact that it's "consistently applied" doesn't save it if it has discriminatory impact.

---

**20. What is the minimum down payment for a conventional loan to avoid PMI?**
A) 5%
B) 10%
C) 20%
D) 25%

**Answer: C.** PMI is required when LTV exceeds 80%, meaning the borrower must put at least **20% down** to avoid PMI on a conventional loan. Below 20%, PMI is required.

---

## 📝 PART 3: FINAL PRACTICE — 5 MORE CURVEBALL QUESTIONS

**21. A borrower has identical loan quotes from two lenders with the same interest rate but different APRs. Which has lower costs?**
A) The one with the lower APR
B) The one with the higher APR
C) They have identical costs since the rate is the same
D) Cannot determine without seeing the amortization schedules

**Answer: A.** APR includes fees and the interest rate. A lower APR with the same interest rate means fewer fees. APR is the "true cost" comparison tool specifically designed for this purpose.

---

**22. A USDA loan applicant earns $90,000 per year. The 115% AMI for their county is $85,000. Are they eligible?**
A) Yes — USDA income limits don't apply to first-time buyers
B) No — their income exceeds the 115% AMI limit
C) Yes — if they put 10% down
D) No — but they can reapply in 6 months

**Answer: B.** USDA income limits are firm — if household income exceeds 115% of Area Median Income, the borrower is ineligible regardless of first-time buyer status, down payment, or other factors.

---

**23. An ARM has an initial rate of 3.75%, a margin of 2.25%, and the current SOFR index is 4.5%. What is the fully indexed rate?**
A) 3.75%
B) 6.00%
C) 6.75%
D) 4.50%

**Answer: C.** Fully indexed rate = Index + Margin = 4.5% + 2.25% = **6.75%**. The initial rate (3.75%) is irrelevant to this calculation.

---

**24. A borrower who closed a refinance on Monday wants to rescind. By what time do they have to notify the lender?**
A) By midnight Wednesday
B) By midnight Thursday
C) By midnight Friday
D) By midnight Saturday

**Answer: B.** 3 business days (specific definition — all except Sundays and federal holidays). Monday close: Day 1 = Tuesday, Day 2 = Wednesday, Day 3 = Thursday. Rescission expires Thursday at midnight.

---

**25. A borrower receives rental income of $2,400/month from a rental property. For qualifying purposes, the usable rental income is:**
A) $2,400
B) $1,920
C) $1,800
D) $1,200

**Answer: C.** Rental income = 75% of gross. $2,400 × 0.75 = $1,800. The 25% vacancy/expense factor is applied.
