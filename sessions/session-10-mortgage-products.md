## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

Understanding mortgage product types is essential for the SAFE exam. You need to know the structure, features, risks, and typical use cases for each product type. Expect 10-15 questions on mortgage products, especially ARM structure and reverse mortgages.

---

### 1. Fixed-Rate Mortgages

**What It Is:**
A mortgage where the interest rate stays the same for the entire loan term. Monthly principal and interest (P&I) payments never change.

**Common Fixed-Rate Terms:**

| Term | Typical Use | Rate vs. 30-yr | Monthly Payment | Equity Build Speed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **30-year** | Most common | Baseline | Lowest | Slowest |
| **20-year** | Balance of term/payment | Slightly lower | Moderate | Moderate |
| **15-year** | Pay off faster, save interest | Lower than 30 | Higher | Fast |
| **10-year** | Maximum paydown speed | Lowest of all | Highest | Fastest |

**Trade-offs:**
- **Longer term** (30-year): Lower monthly payment, more total interest paid, slower equity build
- **Shorter term** (15-year): Higher payment, dramatically less interest, faster equity build and payoff

**Example — $300,000 Loan:**
- 30-year at 7%: ~$1,996/month P&I, total interest ≈ $418,000
- 15-year at 6.5%: ~$2,613/month P&I, total interest ≈ $170,000

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Shorter-term loans have **lower rates** but **higher payments** and much less total interest paid. MLOs should explain this trade-off clearly.

---

### 2. Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs)

**What It Is:**
A mortgage where the interest rate changes periodically based on a market index. ARMs have an initial fixed-rate period, then adjust.

---

**ARM Components — Know All of These:**

| Component | Definition | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Index** | Benchmark rate the ARM is tied to | SOFR, Treasury rate |
| **Margin** | Fixed spread added to the index | 2.5% |
| **Fully Indexed Rate** | Index + Margin | Index 3.5% + Margin 2.5% = 6.0% |
| **Initial Rate** | Rate for the fixed period | 5.25% (may be below or above fully indexed rate) |
| **Adjustment Period** | How often the rate changes after initial period | Every 1 year |
| **Caps** | Limits on how much rate can change | Initial/Periodic/Lifetime |
| **Floor** | Minimum rate the ARM can ever go to | Usually equals the margin |
| **Ceiling** | Maximum rate (lifetime cap applied to start rate) | Start 5% + 5% lifetime cap = max 10% |

---

**ARM Naming Convention:**
Written as **X/Y**:
- **X** = years of initial fixed rate
- **Y** = adjustment frequency after initial period

| ARM Type | Fixed Period | Then Adjusts |
|---|---|---|
| **5/1 ARM** | Fixed for 5 years | Every 1 year after |
| **7/1 ARM** | Fixed for 7 years | Every 1 year after |
| **10/1 ARM** | Fixed for 10 years | Every 1 year after |
| **5/6 ARM** | Fixed for 5 years | Every 6 months after |
| **3/1 ARM** | Fixed for 3 years | Every 1 year after |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The first number = initial fixed period (in years). The second number = how often it adjusts after that (in years or "6" for 6 months). A 5/1 ARM is fixed for 5 years, then adjusts every year.

---

**ARM Cap Structure — Critical Knowledge:**

ARM rate changes are limited by **caps**. The standard cap structure is written as **X/Y/Z**:

| Position | Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **X (First cap)** | Initial adjustment cap | Max rate change at first adjustment |
| **Y (Second cap)** | Periodic cap | Max rate change at each subsequent adjustment |
| **Z (Third cap)** | Lifetime cap | Max total change from initial rate over the life of the loan |

**Cap Structure Example — 2/2/5:**
- Initial fixed rate: 5.5%
- **2** = first adjustment can go no higher than 5.5% + 2% = **7.5%**
- **2** = each subsequent adjustment can change by no more than **2%** up or down
- **5** = lifetime cap means rate can never exceed 5.5% + 5% = **10.5%** (or go below 5.5% - 5% = 0.5%)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** A 2/2/5 cap structure is the most commonly tested. Know what each number means.

**Example ARM Scenario:**
- 5/1 ARM with 2/2/5 caps
- Initial rate: 4%
- Year 6 index: 5%, margin: 2.5% → Fully indexed rate: 7.5%
- First adjustment cap: 4% + 2% = 6% max → Rate goes to **6%** (not 7.5%, because cap limits it)
- Year 7 index: 6%, margin: 2.5% → Fully indexed rate: 8.5%
- Periodic cap: 6% + 2% = 8% max → Rate goes to **8%** (not 8.5%, capped again)
- Lifetime ceiling: 4% + 5% = 9% → Rate can never exceed 9%

---

**Index — SOFR Replaced LIBOR:**

- **LIBOR** (London Interbank Offered Rate) was the primary ARM index for decades
- **LIBOR was phased out in 2023** due to manipulation scandals
- **SOFR** (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is the primary replacement index in the U.S.
- Other indexes: 1-year Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT), Cost of Funds Index (COFI)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **SOFR replaced LIBOR** as the benchmark index for adjustable-rate loans. Both may appear on the exam. Know that LIBOR is defunct.

---

**When ARMs Make Sense:**
- Borrower plans to sell or refinance before the initial period ends
- Borrower believes rates will fall
- Borrower needs a lower initial payment to qualify
- Short-term housing need (military, temporary relocation)

**ARM Risks:**
- Payment shock when rate adjusts
- Uncertainty of future payments
- Can still be HPML if rate is high enough

---

### 3. Balloon Mortgages

**What It Is:**
A loan with fixed payments for a period, then the **entire remaining balance** (the "balloon") is due at maturity.

**Common Balloon Structures:**
- **5/25 balloon**: 5-year term, amortized as if 25-year loan; remaining balance due at year 5
- **7/23 balloon**: 7-year term, amortized as if 23-year loan; remaining balance due at year 7

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Balloon mortgages are **generally prohibited under QM**. HOEPA also prohibits balloon payments on high-cost loans. Narrow exceptions exist for small creditors in rural/underserved areas.

**Why They're Used:**
- Lower initial rate (similar to short-term ARM)
- Lender limits interest rate risk
- Borrower plans to sell or refinance before maturity

**Risk:**
If the borrower cannot refinance or sell when the balloon is due → foreclosure risk ("balloon default")

---

### 4. Interest-Only Loans

**What It Is:**
During the interest-only (IO) period, the borrower pays only interest. No principal is reduced. After the IO period, the loan re-amortizes (or converts), and payments jump.

**Example:**
- $400,000 loan at 6%, 30-year with 10-year IO period
- IO payment: $400,000 × 6% ÷ 12 = $2,000/month (no principal paid)
- After year 10: Balance is still $400,000, now amortized over 20 years → payment jumps to ~$2,866/month

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Interest-only loans are **NOT Qualified Mortgages** — prohibited under QM. They're also very risky because the borrower builds no equity during the IO period.

---

### 5. Negative Amortization

**What It Is:**
When the monthly payment is less than the interest due, the difference is added to the loan balance. The balance **grows** instead of shrinking.

**Example:**
- Loan balance: $300,000 at 6% interest
- Monthly interest due: $1,500
- Minimum payment option: $1,000
- Shortfall added to balance: $500/month → balance grows to $300,500

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Negative amortization = **PROHIBITED in QM**. HOEPA also prohibits it on high-cost loans. Payment option ARMs (pick-a-payment) that could result in neg am are gone from the market.

---

### 6. Buy-Down Mortgages

**Types of Buy-Downs:**

**Temporary Buy-Down:**
- Seller or builder pays to temporarily reduce the borrower's interest rate for the first 1-3 years
- Most common: **2-1 buydown** (rate is 2% below note rate in year 1, 1% below in year 2, then note rate in year 3+)
- Money is put in escrow; as payment increases, escrow covers the difference
- Borrower qualifies at the note rate (not the reduced rate) under most programs

**Example of 2-1 Buydown:**
- Note rate: 7%
- Year 1: Borrower pays 5%
- Year 2: Borrower pays 6%
- Year 3+: Borrower pays 7%

**Permanent Buy-Down (Discount Points):**
- Paying "points" upfront to permanently reduce the interest rate
- **1 point = 1% of the loan amount**
- Each point typically reduces the rate by 0.25% (varies by lender and market)
- Example: 1 point on $300,000 = $3,000 upfront → rate drops from 7% to 6.75%

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **1 discount point = 1% of the loan amount.** Paying points is always an upfront cost in exchange for a lower rate over the life of the loan.

**Break-Even Analysis:**
- Time to recoup point cost = upfront point cost ÷ monthly savings
- If break-even is 7 years and borrower plans to sell in 4 years → buying points doesn't make sense

---

### 7. Construction Loans

**Types:**

**Construction-to-Permanent (Single-Close):**
- One loan, one closing
- Construction phase: Borrower pays interest only on drawn funds
- At completion: Loan automatically converts to permanent mortgage
- Benefit: One set of closing costs, locked rate (in some cases)

**Two-Close Construction:**
- Two separate loans: One construction loan + one permanent mortgage
- Two closings, two sets of closing costs
- Benefit: Flexibility to shop for best permanent rate when construction is complete
- Risk: Rates may change between closings

**How Construction Draws Work:**
- Funds are NOT disbursed all at once
- Drawn in stages (foundation, framing, rough-in, drywall, completion)
- Inspections required before each draw
- Interest accrues only on drawn amounts

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Construction loans accrue interest only on **drawn funds** (the amount actually disbursed), not the full loan amount.

---

### 8. Reverse Mortgages (HECM)

**What It Is:**
A **Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM)** is a reverse mortgage insured by FHA that allows homeowners 62+ to convert home equity into cash without monthly mortgage payments.

**Key Features:**

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Eligible borrowers** | Age **62 or older** |
| **Property requirement** | Primary residence only |
| **Insurance** | FHA-insured (HECM) |
| **Monthly payments** | **None required** |
| **Loan becomes due when:** | Borrower dies, sells, moves out (12+ months non-occupancy), fails to maintain property or pay taxes/insurance |
| **Non-recourse** | Borrower/heirs never owe more than the home is worth |
| **HUD counseling** | Required before applying |
| **Maximum claim amount** | Limited by FHA loan limits |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The "magic number" for reverse mortgages is **62** (age requirement). Also: HUD counseling is **required** before applying (just like HOEPA loans). No monthly payment required — the loan balance grows over time.

**How HECM Proceeds Are Received:**
- Lump sum (fixed rate only)
- Monthly payments (tenure or term)
- Line of credit
- Combination

**Non-Recourse Feature:**
If the loan balance exceeds the home value at payoff, FHA insurance covers the difference. Heirs can pay off the loan (at 95% of appraised value), sell the home, or walk away.

**Required Counseling:**
All HECM borrowers must receive counseling from a HUD-approved reverse mortgage counselor before applying.

---

### 9. Jumbo Loans

**What It Is:**
A jumbo loan is a mortgage that exceeds the **conforming loan limit** set by the FHFA (Federal Housing Finance Agency).

**Conforming Loan Limits (2024):**
- Standard limit: **$766,550** (single-unit property)
- High-cost areas: Up to **$1,149,825** (150% of standard)
- Multi-unit properties have higher limits

**Jumbo Loan Characteristics:**
- Cannot be sold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
- Higher credit requirements (typically **720+** credit score)
- More reserves required (often 12+ months PITI)
- Lower max LTV (often 80% or less for larger amounts)
- Higher documentation requirements
- Higher rates than conforming loans (generally)
- Not eligible for FHA, VA, or USDA programs

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Jumbo loans **cannot be sold to FNMA or FHLMC** because they exceed conforming loan limits. They're kept in portfolio or sold in private markets.

A) 4.75%
B) 5.75%
C) 8.5%
D) 7.5%

---

### Answer Key

**1. B — 6.5%.** Initial rate: 4.5%. Initial adjustment cap: 2%. Maximum at first adjustment: 4.5% + 2% = 6.5%. Even though the fully indexed rate would be 7.5%, the initial cap limits the first adjustment to 6.5%.

**2. C — 30-year fixed with 2.5% points and fees.** Points and fees at 2.5% are below the 3% QM cap. Interest-only, balloon, and negative amortization all disqualify a loan from QM status.

**3. C — $7,000.** 2 points = 2% of $350,000. 2% × $350,000 = $7,000.

**4. B — SOFR.** LIBOR was phased out in 2023. SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is now the primary benchmark index for ARMs.

**5. C — HECM reverse mortgage.** A HECM is the product specifically designed for homeowners 62+ to access equity without monthly payments. Cash-out refi and HELOC both require monthly payments.

**6. B — 6%.** In a 2-1 buydown: Year 1 = note rate - 2% = 5%; Year 2 = note rate - 1% = 6%; Year 3+ = note rate = 7%.

**7. C — $250,600.** Monthly interest: $1,500. Payment made: $900. Shortfall: $1,500 - $900 = $600 added to balance. New balance: $250,000 + $600 = $250,600. This is negative amortization.

**8. C — Automatically converts to permanent.** A construction-to-permanent loan converts automatically at completion — this is the defining feature of a single-close loan, requiring only one set of closing costs. Interest accrues only on drawn amounts (not the full amount).

**9. B — No — balance exceeds conforming limit.** The conforming loan limit is $766,550 (standard) or up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas. A $900,000 balance would exceed the standard limit (though might be possible in a high-cost area). In most areas, this would remain a jumbo loan.

**10. B — 5.75%.** Fully indexed rate = index (2%) + margin (2.75%) = 4.75%. But wait — the initial cap for this 5/2/5 ARM is 5%. First adjustment: 3.5% + 5% = 8.5% maximum, but fully indexed rate is only 4.75%, which is within the cap. So the rate goes to **4.75%**. Actually — re-reading: index 2% + margin 2.75% = 4.75% fully indexed. Cap at first adjustment = 5/2/5, so first cap is 5%: 3.5% + 5% = 8.5% max. Fully indexed rate (4.75%) is below the cap. Rate = **4.75%**. Answer A is correct.

> **Note for answer 10:** Corrected answer is **A — 4.75%**. The fully indexed rate (4.75%) is below the initial cap ceiling (8.5%), so the rate adjusts to the fully indexed rate of 4.75%. None of the provided options is exactly right; A (4.75%) is closest.
