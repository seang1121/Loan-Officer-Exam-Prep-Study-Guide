## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

Fair lending laws are among the **most heavily tested topics** on the NMLS SAFE exam. You'll see 15-20 questions touching ECOA, HMDA, Fair Housing, and disparate treatment/impact. These laws overlap — knowing where one ends and another begins is crucial.

---

### 1. ECOA — Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Regulation B)

**What It Is:**
ECOA prohibits discrimination in any aspect of a credit transaction. Implemented by **Regulation B**, enforced by the CFPB.

**ECOA's Protected Classes (7+1):**
| Class | Notes |
|---|---|
| Race | All races |
| Color | Skin color |
| Religion | Any faith |
| National Origin | Country of origin |
| Sex | Gender |
| Marital Status | Cannot ask if married/divorced to deny credit |
| Age | Cannot deny credit because of age (must be of legal age) |
| Receipt of public assistance | Food stamps, welfare, etc. |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** ECOA covers **AGE** and **MARITAL STATUS** — Fair Housing does NOT. This is the #1 tested distinction.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** ECOA also protects anyone who has exercised rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.

---

**What Counts as a Credit Transaction Under ECOA?**
- Applying for a mortgage
- Applying for a credit card or auto loan
- Any extension of credit
- Renewals, refinances, modifications

ECOA applies to **ALL creditors** — banks, mortgage companies, retailers, anyone who extends credit regularly.

---

**Adverse Action Notices Under ECOA:**

When a lender **denies credit, takes adverse action, or makes a counteroffer**, they must:

1. **Notify the applicant** within specific timeframes
2. **State the specific reasons** for the adverse action (or inform the applicant of their right to receive reasons)

| Situation | Timeframe |
|---|---|
| Application denial | 30 days after receiving completed application |
| Incomplete application — inaction | 30 days after notice of incompleteness |
| Counteroffer refused by applicant | 90 days after making the counteroffer |
| Account terminated | 30 days after termination |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The magic number is **30 days**. Adverse action notice must go out within 30 days of a completed application being denied.

**Contents of an Adverse Action Notice:**
- Statement of action taken
- Name and address of creditor
- Statement of anti-discrimination provisions (ECOA notice)
- Name/address of federal agency that enforces compliance
- **Either:** The specific reasons for adverse action **OR** disclosure of the right to request reasons within 60 days

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The lender must provide **specific reasons** — saying "didn't meet our standards" is NOT enough. They must say "insufficient income" or "too many existing debts."

---

**Spousal Signature Rules Under ECOA:**

This is a classic trap question. ECOA says a lender **CANNOT require a spouse's signature** unless:
- The spouse is a co-borrower
- The spouse will be on the title
- The property is community property in a community property state
- The non-applicant spouse's income is needed to qualify

**Why this matters:** Before ECOA, lenders required wives to have their husbands co-sign everything. ECOA ended that.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** A lender violates ECOA if they require a spousal signature solely because of marriage, with no other justification.

---

**Prohibited Inquiries Under ECOA:**

Lenders CANNOT ask:
- Whether you plan to have children or bear children
- Your spouse's income (unless relying on it)
- Your birth control methods (really — this happened before ECOA)
- About alimony/child support UNLESS voluntarily disclosed and you want it counted

Lenders CAN ask:
- Your age (to verify legal age to enter contract)
- Whether you receive alimony (if you want it considered as income)
- Marital status — ONLY if relevant to property laws (community property states)

---

**Self-Employed Income Under ECOA:**

ECOA does not prohibit lenders from asking for additional documentation from self-employed borrowers — the law requires equal treatment, not identical treatment. Requiring 2 years of tax returns from a self-employed borrower while requiring only a pay stub from a W-2 employee is **NOT discrimination** — it's appropriate underwriting.

---

### 2. HMDA — Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (Regulation C)

**What It Is:**
HMDA requires covered financial institutions to collect and report data on mortgage applications. Implemented by **Regulation C**, enforced by the CFPB.

**Purpose of HMDA:**
1. Detect and prevent **redlining**
2. Help government officials identify **discrimination patterns**
3. Inform the public about lenders' lending practices
4. Attract private investment to underserved communities

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** HMDA was created to **detect redlining** by requiring lenders to report where they lend and where they don't.

---

**Who Must Report Under HMDA?**

Covered institutions include:
- Banks, credit unions, savings associations that meet thresholds
- **Asset threshold:** Generally $54 million+ in assets (adjusted annually)
- **Origination threshold:** 25+ closed-end loans OR 100+ open-end lines in each of the previous 2 years
- Must operate in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Not all lenders must file HMDA. Small lenders below the threshold are exempt. If the exam asks about a tiny rural credit union, they may be exempt.

---

**What Data Is Collected?**

The Loan Application Register (LAR) collects:
- Loan type (conventional, FHA, VA, USDA)
- Loan purpose (purchase, refinance, home improvement)
- Property type and location
- Loan amount
- **Race, ethnicity, sex, and age** of applicant (collected but cannot be used in lending decision)
- Action taken (originated, denied, withdrawn, etc.)
- Income of applicant
- Credit score
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Loan-to-value ratio
- Pricing information (rate spread)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Lenders must ask for race/ethnicity/sex information — NOT to use it in decisions, but to report it to the government for fair lending analysis. Refusing to provide this info is borrower's right; lender records it as "information not provided."

---

**LAR Filing Deadline:**
- **March 1** of the following year
- Data must be submitted to the CFPB/FFIEC
- Lenders with 60,000+ records must submit quarterly

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **March 1** is the HMDA LAR filing deadline. Memorize this.

---

**HMDA Data Action Taken Codes:**
| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1 | Loan originated |
| 2 | Application approved but not accepted |
| 3 | Application denied |
| 4 | Application withdrawn by applicant |
| 5 | File closed for incompleteness |
| 6 | Loan purchased |
| 7 | Pre-approval request denied |
| 8 | Pre-approval request approved but not accepted |

---

### 3. Fair Housing Act

**What It Is:**
The Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) prohibits discrimination in the **sale, rental, and financing** of housing.

**The 7 Protected Classes Under the Fair Housing Act:**
1. **Race**
2. **Color**
3. **National Origin**
4. **Religion**
5. **Sex**
6. **Familial Status** (families with children under 18, pregnant women, people securing custody of children)
7. **Handicap/Disability** (physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — THE BIG TRAP:** The Fair Housing Act has **7** classes. ECOA has **9** (adds Age and Marital Status). Many questions try to confuse these.

**Mnemonic for Fair Housing 7 Classes: "FRESH RC"**
- **F** — Familial Status
- **R** — Race
- **E** — (no E... try another)

Try this one: **"Race, Color, Religion, NatOrigin, Sex, Familial, Handicap"** → **"RC RNSFH"**

Or simply: **FARNS + CH** (Familial, mAritAl is NOT here, Race, National origin, Sex + Color, Handicap)

Best memorization: **Just list them 7 times until they're automatic.**

---

**What the Fair Housing Act Covers:**
- Refusing to sell or rent
- Setting different terms or conditions
- Advertising in a discriminatory way ("preferred neighborhood" = Fair Housing violation)
- Blockbusting (inducing owners to sell by saying minorities are moving in)
- Steering (directing buyers to or away from neighborhoods based on protected class)
- Refusing to provide information about available properties

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **Steering** is a Fair Housing AND ECOA violation. An MLO who pushes minority borrowers toward higher-rate products commits reverse redlining.

---

**Exemptions to the Fair Housing Act:**

Not everything falls under Fair Housing. The act exempts:
1. **Single-family homes sold or rented by the owner** (private seller, no broker, no discriminatory advertising)
2. **Owner-occupied buildings with 4 or fewer units** ("Mrs. Murphy exemption")
3. **Religious organizations** — can give preference to members for housing they own
4. **Private clubs** — can give preference to members for housing they own

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** These exemptions are heavily tested. A homeowner selling their own home without a real estate agent can technically discriminate. BUT — they still cannot use discriminatory advertising.

**No exemption exists for race/color** — these are always protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (42 U.S.C. § 1982), which has no exemptions.

---

**Disability Accommodations Under Fair Housing:**

Landlords/lenders must:
- Allow **reasonable modifications** to the property (at tenant's expense)
- Make **reasonable accommodations** to rules or policies
- Design/construct accessible multi-family housing (4+ units, built after 1991)

---

### 4. Disparate Treatment vs. Disparate Impact

These two concepts explain HOW discrimination occurs — and both can be illegal.

**Disparate Treatment:**
- **Definition:** Treating applicants differently based on a protected class
- **Intent:** Required (treating someone differently BECAUSE of their class)
- **Example:** Requiring additional documentation from minority applicants that white applicants don't have to provide
- **Also called:** Intentional discrimination

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Disparate treatment = intent matters. The lender MEANT to discriminate.

**Disparate Impact:**
- **Definition:** A facially neutral policy has a disproportionate negative effect on a protected class
- **Intent:** NOT required — no discriminatory intent needed
- **Example:** A minimum loan amount policy that effectively excludes all borrowers in a minority neighborhood
- **Defense:** Business necessity — if the policy is necessary for a legitimate business reason AND no less discriminatory alternative exists

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Disparate impact = no intent needed. A policy can be perfectly neutral on its face but still be illegal if it hurts a protected class disproportionately.

| | Disparate Treatment | Disparate Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Intent required? | Yes | No |
| Also called | Intentional discrimination | Unintentional discrimination |
| Example | Charging higher fees to Hispanic borrowers | Loan minimum excludes minority neighborhoods |
| Defense | None (it's intentional) | Business necessity |

---

**Redlining:**
Drawing geographic lines around minority neighborhoods and refusing to lend there.
- **Modern redlining** is subtler: setting loan minimums too low to cover home prices only in minority areas, steering, etc.
- HMDA data is the primary tool used to detect redlining patterns

**Reverse Redlining:**
- Targeting minority neighborhoods with predatory or inferior products
- Example: Pushing subprime loans on minority borrowers who qualify for prime rates

---

### 5. CRA — Community Reinvestment Act

**What It Is:**
The Community Reinvestment Act (1977) encourages depository institutions to meet the credit needs of **low- and moderate-income (LMI)** communities in their assessment areas.

**Key Points:**
- Applies to **federally regulated depository institutions** (banks, savings associations, credit unions)
- Does NOT apply to mortgage companies or independent mortgage bankers
- Regulators examine CRA compliance and issue ratings: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, Substantial Noncompliance
- Poor CRA ratings can block bank mergers, acquisitions, and branch openings
- **Assessment area:** The geographic area where the bank takes deposits and makes loans

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** CRA applies to **banks** — not mortgage companies. This trips people up.

**CRA Examination Categories:**
1. **Lending test** — Does the bank make loans in LMI areas?
2. **Investment test** — Does the bank invest in LMI communities (bonds, grants)?
3. **Service test** — Does the bank have branches in LMI areas?

---

### Putting It All Together: The Fair Lending Framework

| Law | Enforced By | Covers | Key Distinction |
|---|---|---|---|
| ECOA (Reg B) | CFPB | All credit transactions | Adds Age + Marital Status |
| Fair Housing Act | HUD + DOJ | Residential housing | 7 classes, has exemptions |
| HMDA (Reg C) | CFPB | Reporting only, not lending | Data collection to detect discrimination |
| CRA | OCC, FDIC, Fed | Banks only | Affirmative obligation to lend in LMI areas |

C) ECOA
D) CRA

---

### Answer Key

**1. C — Disparate treatment.** Intentionally requiring more documentation from minority applicants is treating them differently because of their race — that's disparate treatment (intentional discrimination).

**2. C — HMDA.** The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires collection and reporting of race/ethnicity/sex data on mortgage applications.

**3. C — March 31.** ECOA requires the adverse action notice within 30 days of the completed application. March 1 + 30 days = March 31.

**4. C — Age.** Age is protected under ECOA but NOT the Fair Housing Act. Fair Housing protects: Race, Color, Religion, National Origin, Sex, Familial Status, Handicap.

**5. C — March 1.** HMDA LAR data must be filed by March 1 of the following year.

**6. C — Disparate impact.** The policy is facially neutral (no loan minimums) but has a disproportionate negative effect on minority borrowers. No discriminatory intent required for disparate impact.

**7. B — XYZ Credit Union.** CRA applies only to federally regulated depository institutions. Mortgage companies, brokers, and independent lenders are NOT covered by CRA.

**8. C — Asking about plans to have children.** This is a prohibited inquiry under ECOA — it could signal intent to discriminate based on familial status or sex.

**9. B — Yes — religion has no exemption.** The Fair Housing Act's private seller exemption does NOT cover race or color (protected by Civil Rights Act of 1866). Religion, while not covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1866, is covered by the Fair Housing Act, and the private seller exemption technically still applies to religion — HOWEVER, this question is testing the concept that private sellers lose their exemption if they use discriminatory advertising. Answer B is the best answer for exam purposes as religion is always a protected class.

> ⚠️ Note: Technically, the private seller exemption CAN apply to religion for a private individual seller with no advertising. But the exam typically tests this as "religion is always protected." Go with B.

**10. C — ECOA.** Requiring a spousal signature when the applicant qualifies alone violates ECOA's prohibition on discrimination based on marital status.
