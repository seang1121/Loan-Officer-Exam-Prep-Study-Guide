## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

Underwriting is the heart of the mortgage process — it's where loan decisions are made. The SAFE exam tests credit score thresholds, derogatory credit waiting periods, AUS systems, and appraisal independence. Expect 12-18 questions from this area.

---

### 1. Credit Scores — The Basics

**What Is a Credit Score?**
A credit score is a numerical representation of a consumer's creditworthiness based on their credit history. The most commonly used model is the **FICO score** (Fair Isaac Corporation).

**Tri-Merge Credit Report:**
For mortgages, lenders pull credit from all 3 bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) and use the **middle score** of the three for qualifying purposes.

- If there are two borrowers, lenders use the **lower middle score** of the two borrowers
- Example: Borrower 1 scores: 720, 740, 735 → middle score = 735
- Borrower 2 scores: 680, 695, 688 → middle score = 688
- Qualifying score = **688** (lower of the two middle scores)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Always use the **middle score** from the tri-merge report. With multiple borrowers, use the **lower** of the qualifying scores.

---

**FICO Score Ranges:**

| Range | Rating | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **800-850** | Exceptional | Best rates, easiest approvals |
| **740-799** | Very Good | Great rates, minimal scrutiny |
| **670-739** | Good | Standard rates, most programs available |
| **580-669** | Fair | Higher rates, limited programs, FHA possible |
| **Below 580** | Poor | Very limited options |

---

**Minimum Credit Scores by Loan Type:**

| Loan Type | Minimum Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Conventional** | **620** (typically) | Fannie/Freddie guidelines |
| **FHA (3.5% down)** | **580** | With 3.5% minimum down payment |
| **FHA (10% down)** | **500-579** | 10% down payment required |
| **VA** | **No VA minimum** (lenders often require 620) | VA itself doesn't set a score floor |
| **USDA** | **640** (typically) | USDA requires GUS approval |
| **Jumbo** | **700-720+** (varies by lender) | Non-agency, lender sets own rules |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** FHA has a hard floor of **500** (with 10% down). Below 500 = no FHA loan. The **VA itself does not set a minimum score** — this is tested.

---

### 2. Credit Report Components — The FICO Formula

FICO scores are calculated using 5 factors:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| **Payment History** | **35%** | On-time vs. late payments — largest factor |
| **Amounts Owed** | **30%** | Credit utilization (how much credit is being used) |
| **Length of Credit History** | **15%** | Age of oldest account, average age |
| **New Credit** | **10%** | Recent inquiries, newly opened accounts |
| **Credit Mix** | **10%** | Variety of credit types (revolving, installment, etc.) |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Payment history (35%) and amounts owed (30%) together make up **65%** of the FICO score. These are the biggest levers borrowers can use to improve their score.

**Credit Utilization:**
The ratio of credit card balances to credit card limits. Recommended: Keep below 30% of available credit.
- Example: $3,000 balance on a $10,000 limit = 30% utilization
- High utilization (>70%) significantly hurts scores

---

**Hard vs. Soft Inquiries:**
- **Hard inquiry:** Lender pulls credit for a loan/credit card application — temporarily reduces score (5-10 points)
- **Soft inquiry:** Borrower checks own score, employer checks, pre-approval screening — does NOT affect score
- Multiple mortgage-related hard inquiries within 45 days are typically treated as ONE inquiry for FICO scoring purposes (rate shopping protection)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Rate shopping for a mortgage is protected — multiple mortgage pulls within 45 days count as one inquiry. Encourage borrowers to shop!

---

### 3. Derogatory Credit — Types and Timelines

**Late Payments:**
- 30-day late, 60-day late, 90-day late, 120+ day late
- More recent and more severe = more damage to score
- Most lenders require no late payments in the past 12-24 months for prime lending

**Collections and Charge-Offs:**
- **Collection:** Debt sent to a collection agency
- **Charge-off:** Lender writes off the debt as a loss (but it's still owed)
- Both stay on credit for **7 years** from date of first delinquency
- FHA: Medical collections may be excluded from DTI in some cases
- Conventional: Lenders vary on collection requirements

**Judgments:**
- Court-ordered money judgments stay on credit for **7 years** or until the statute of limitations expires (whichever is longer)
- Must generally be paid before closing on a conventional loan
- FHA: Judgments typically must be paid or on a payment plan

**Tax Liens:**
- Federal tax liens: Must be paid before most conventional lenders will approve
- Released tax liens: 7 years on credit from release date

---

**Foreclosure Waiting Periods:**

| Loan Type | Waiting Period After Foreclosure |
|---|---|
| **Conventional** (standard) | **7 years** from completion date |
| **Conventional** (with extenuating circumstances) | **3 years** with 10% down and max 90% LTV |
| **FHA** | **3 years** from completion date |
| **VA** | **2 years** from completion date |
| **USDA** | **3 years** from completion date |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Foreclosure waiting periods: Conventional = 7 years, FHA = 3 years, VA = 2 years. VA is the most lenient.

---

**Short Sale Waiting Periods:**

| Loan Type | Waiting Period After Short Sale |
|---|---|
| **Conventional** | **4 years** (standard); 2 years with extenuating circumstances |
| **FHA** | **3 years** (if in default at time of sale); may be 0-3 years if never delinquent |
| **VA** | **2 years** (if VA loan was involved); 0 if not delinquent |
| **USDA** | **3 years** |

---

**Bankruptcy Waiting Periods:**

| Loan Type | Chapter 7 | Chapter 13 |
|---|---|---|
| **Conventional** | **4 years** from discharge | **2 years** from discharge OR 4 years from dismissal |
| **FHA** | **2 years** from discharge | **1 year** into repayment plan (court approval needed) |
| **VA** | **2 years** from discharge | **1 year** into repayment plan |
| **USDA** | **3 years** from discharge | **1 year** into repayment plan |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — MOST TESTED:** 
> - Conventional BK7: **4 years** from discharge
> - FHA BK7: **2 years** from discharge
> - FHA Chapter 13: Can get FHA loan after **1 year of payments** (with court approval)
> - BK7 stays on credit for 10 years; BK13 stays 7 years (reporting only — waiting periods are measured from discharge, not when it drops off credit)

---

**Waiting Period Summary Table (Derogatory Events):**

| Event | Conventional | FHA | VA | USDA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Foreclosure | 7 years | 3 years | 2 years | 3 years |
| Short sale | 4 years | 3 years | 2 years | 3 years |
| BK Chapter 7 | 4 years | 2 years | 2 years | 3 years |
| BK Chapter 13 | 2 yrs from discharge | 1 yr in plan | 1 yr in plan | 1 yr in plan |

---

### 4. Reserves

**What Are Reserves?**
Reserves are liquid assets remaining after the down payment and closing costs are paid. They're measured in months of PITI.

**Standard Reserve Requirements:**

| Loan Type | Minimum Reserves |
|---|---|
| **Conventional (primary, 1-unit)** | Usually 2 months PITI |
| **Conventional (2nd home)** | 2 months PITI |
| **Conventional (investment, 1-4 unit)** | 6 months PITI |
| **FHA** | No minimum required (but helps with compensating factors) |
| **VA** | No minimum required (but residual income considered) |
| **USDA** | No minimum required |
| **Jumbo** | Typically 12+ months PITI |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** FHA and VA do NOT require reserves, but having reserves can help with compensating factors on high-DTI loans.

**What Counts as Reserves:**
- Checking/savings accounts (100%)
- 401(k)/IRA (60% of vested balance for conventional)
- Stocks/bonds (70% of value)
- Gift funds: Do NOT count as reserves (can be used for down payment but not reserves)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **Gift funds cannot be counted as reserves.** Reserves must be the borrower's own funds.

---

### 5. Automated Underwriting Systems (AUS)

**What Is AUS?**
AUS is software that evaluates a loan application and provides a recommendation based on loan data compared to the investor's guidelines.

**The Two Major AUS Systems:**

| System | GSE | Recommendation Types |
|---|---|---|
| **Desktop Underwriter (DU)** | **Fannie Mae (FNMA)** | Approve/Eligible, Refer, Refer with Caution |
| **Loan Product Advisor (LPA)** | **Freddie Mac (FHLMC)** | Accept, Caution, Ineligible |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** DU = Fannie Mae. LPA = Freddie Mac (formerly called Loan Prospector/LP). This is directly tested — don't mix them up.

**AUS Recommendation Meanings:**

| DU Finding | LPA Finding | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Approve/Eligible | Accept | Loan meets guidelines — approve with documentation |
| Refer | Caution | AUS can't approve — requires manual underwriting review |
| Refer with Caution | Ineligible | Significant issues — likely denial |

---

**Benefits of AUS:**
- Faster processing (seconds vs. days for manual)
- Consistent application of guidelines
- May allow reduced documentation (streamlined doc requirements)
- Identifies maximum DTI, LTV, credit score combinations
- Provides specific conditions to satisfy

---

### 6. Manual Underwriting

**When Manual Underwriting Is Required:**
- AUS returns Refer/Caution finding
- Loan is for a non-traditional borrower (thin credit file, no credit score)
- Government programs that allow manual UW (FHA, VA, USDA)
- Unique loan features not programmable into AUS

**Manual Underwriting Process:**
- Human underwriter reviews entire loan file
- Must document and explain each credit decision
- More documentation required (12-24 months bank statements, rental history)
- Letters of explanation (LOX) for any derogatory credit
- More conservative DTI limits (without compensating factors)
- Compensating factors play a larger role

**FHA Manual Underwriting DTI Limits:**
- Maximum 31%/43% without compensating factors
- Up to 37%/47% with one compensating factor
- Up to 40%/50% with two compensating factors

---

### 7. Appraisals and Independence Requirements

**Purpose of an Appraisal:**
An appraisal is an independent professional opinion of a property's market value. It is required for most mortgage transactions.

**Appraiser Independence Requirements (AIR):**
Established by Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac (formalized into federal rules via Dodd-Frank):
- MLOs and loan production staff **CANNOT** select, approve, or influence appraisers
- Lenders must use an **Appraisal Management Company (AMC)** or an approved independent appraiser panel
- Appraisers cannot be pressured to hit a target value
- If an MLO pressures an appraiser = **AIR violation** = potential license revocation

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The MLO **cannot** order the appraisal or select the appraiser. This is a major AIR violation that can result in license loss.

**Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC):**
The predecessor to AIR (2009). Established appraiser independence standards that were later formalized through Dodd-Frank.

---

**Appraisal Delivery Requirements:**

| Requirement | Rule |
|---|---|
| Appraisal copy to borrower | At least **3 business days** before closing |
| When ordered | Promptly after application (lender orders it) |
| Borrower can waive 3-day rule | Yes, in writing at or before consummation |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The borrower must receive a copy of the appraisal **at least 3 business days before closing** — even if they paid for it earlier.

---

**Appraisal Methods (Brief Preview — covered in detail in Session 13):**
- **Sales Comparison:** Compare to recent sales of similar properties (most common for residential)
- **Cost Approach:** Land value + depreciated replacement cost of improvements (new/unique properties)
- **Income Approach:** Value based on income potential (investment properties)

---

**Reconsideration of Value (ROV):**
If a borrower believes the appraisal is too low:
- Borrower may request a Reconsideration of Value
- Must provide comparable sales data supporting higher value
- Appraiser reviews and may or may not change value
- MLO cannot tell appraiser what value is needed — only provide factual data

### Answer Key

**1. B — 710.** With a tri-merge report, use the middle score. Three scores: 695, 710, 720 — arranged in order, the middle is 710. (Not the average — the literal middle number.)

**2. B — No — conventional requires 4 years.** Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge waiting period for conventional loans is 4 years. At 26 months, they've waited just over 2 years — not yet eligible for conventional.

**3. B — AIR violation.** Telling an appraiser a target value is a textbook Appraiser Independence Requirements violation. MLOs cannot communicate a needed value to an appraiser.

**4. B — Meets Fannie Mae guidelines, can be approved with documentation.** An Approve/Eligible finding is NOT a final approval — it means the loan meets guidelines and will be approved if the documentation submitted supports the information entered. The underwriter still reviews and must issue final approval.

**5. C — Payment history (35%).** Payment history is the largest FICO factor at 35%. Amounts owed is 30% — not 35%. Credit mix is 10%, not 30%.

**6. B — No — conventional requires 4 years.** Conventional loans require a 4-year waiting period after a short sale (with no extenuating circumstances). 3.5 years is not sufficient.

**7. C — Yes, with 1 year of on-time payments and court approval.** FHA allows a borrower in an active Chapter 13 to obtain an FHA loan after 12 months of satisfactory payments under the plan, with court trustee approval. Note: the question says "discharged 18 months ago" — if discharged, there is NO waiting period for FHA. Either way, the answer is they qualify — if discharged 18 months ago, FHA only requires 1 year after discharge actually... wait: FHA requires 2 years after Chapter 13 discharge. But if still IN the plan, they can get FHA after 1 year of payments. Answer C remains best as it describes the 1-year in-plan rule.

**8. C — Loan Product Advisor (LPA).** Freddie Mac uses LPA; Fannie Mae uses DU. Do not mix these up.

**9. D — Yes — $8,000 savings is sufficient.** The 2-month requirement of $4,000 can be met with the borrower's $8,000 in savings. Gift funds cannot be reserves, but the $8,000 savings (borrower's own funds) covers the reserve requirement. The 401(k) is additional backup. The requirement is met.

**10. D — VA (if eligible).** VA requires only 2 years after foreclosure. FHA requires 3 years. Conventional requires 7 years. At 28 months (~2.3 years), the borrower meets only VA's 2-year waiting period (assuming they're a qualifying veteran).

---

### Score Guide
- **9-10 correct:** Excellent credit analysis knowledge — move on!
- **7-8 correct:** Review the waiting period table and AUS systems (DU vs. LPA)
- **Below 7:** Re-read the waiting period section carefully and memorize the AUS system names
