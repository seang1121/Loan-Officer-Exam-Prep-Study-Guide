## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

Government-backed loans are heavily tested on the SAFE exam. You'll see questions about FHA MIP, VA funding fees, USDA income limits, and comparisons between programs. Mastering the specific numbers for each program is essential — expect 12-18 questions.

---

### 1. FHA Loans — Federal Housing Administration

**History & Purpose:**
The FHA was created in 1934 during the Great Depression to increase homeownership by making low-down-payment mortgages available. FHA doesn't lend money — it **insures** loans made by approved lenders.

**FHA Loan Basics:**

| Feature | FHA Rule |
|---|---|
| **Minimum down payment** | 3.5% (credit score 580+) |
| **Minimum down payment** | 10% (credit score 500-579) |
| **Credit score minimum** | 500 (below 500 = ineligible) |
| **Loan limits** | Vary by area (set annually by FHA based on area median home prices) |
| **Debt-to-income** | Up to 43% standard; up to 57% with strong compensating factors |
| **Property type** | Primary residence only |
| **Income limits** | None (FHA has no income limits) |
| **Assumable** | Yes — can be assumed by a qualified buyer |
| **Manual underwriting** | Available when AUS can't approve |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** FHA has **no income limits** — anyone can use FHA regardless of income. USDA has income limits. This distinction is tested.

---

**FHA Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP):**

FHA loans require two types of mortgage insurance:

| Type | Amount | When Paid |
|---|---|---|
| **Upfront MIP (UFMIP)** | **1.75%** of base loan amount | At closing (can be financed into loan) |
| **Annual MIP** | Typically **0.55%** (varies by LTV, term) | Monthly, added to payment |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** FHA UFMIP = **1.75%**. This is one of the most commonly tested numbers on the exam. Memorize it.

**Annual MIP Rates (approximate for 30-year, standard loan):**
- LTV > 95%: 0.55% annually
- LTV 90-95%: 0.50% annually
- LTV ≤ 90%: 0.50% annually

**When Does FHA MIP End?**

This is a critical, commonly tested distinction:

| Down Payment | When MIP Ends |
|---|---|
| **Less than 10%** | MIP lasts for the **life of the loan** |
| **10% or more** | MIP cancelled after **11 years** |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** If the borrower puts less than 10% down on an FHA loan, they pay MIP **forever** (unless they refinance out of FHA). This is a major disadvantage compared to conventional loans where PMI cancels at 78% LTV automatically.

---

**FHA Loan Limits:**
- "Floor" (low-cost areas): 65% of conforming loan limit
- "Ceiling" (high-cost areas): 150% of conforming loan limit
- Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands: Even higher limits
- Published annually by HUD

---

**FHA Key Characteristics:**
- **Assumable:** FHA loans can be assumed by a qualified buyer — lender approval required
- **Streamline Refinance:** FHA-to-FHA refinance with reduced documentation (no new appraisal in many cases)
- **Secondary Financing:** Allows down payment assistance programs as secondary financing if they meet FHA guidelines
- **Property Requirements:** Properties must meet HUD's Minimum Property Standards (MPS)

---

**FHA vs. Conventional — When Does FHA Make Sense?**

FHA is better when:
- Credit score is below 620 (can't qualify conventional)
- Down payment is limited (3.5% vs. 5% conventional minimum)
- Higher DTI needed

Conventional is better when:
- Credit score 740+ (PMI is cheaper, rate is better)
- Putting 20%+ down (avoid MIP entirely)
- Can afford higher down payment to avoid lifetime MIP

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** With less than 10% down, FHA MIP lasts forever. Conventional PMI cancels at 78% LTV. For borrowers with decent credit who can make a meaningful down payment, conventional often wins long-term.

---

### 2. VA Loans — Department of Veterans Affairs

**Who Is Eligible:**
- Active duty service members
- Veterans (with qualifying service)
- National Guard and Reserve members (with qualifying service)
- Surviving spouses of service members killed in action (in some cases)

**VA Loan Basics:**

| Feature | VA Rule |
|---|---|
| **Minimum down payment** | **0%** (no down payment required) |
| **Credit score minimum** | No VA minimum (lenders typically require 620) |
| **Loan limits** | No limit for full entitlement (since 2020 Blue Water Navy Act) |
| **PMI** | **None required** |
| **Property type** | Primary residence only |
| **Income limits** | None |
| **Assumable** | Yes — can be assumed by veterans AND civilians |
| **Certificate of Eligibility (COE)** | Required to prove VA entitlement |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** VA loans have **no down payment requirement** and **no PMI** — these are the two biggest advantages. The VA does NOT set a minimum credit score (though lenders do).

---

**VA Funding Fee:**

Instead of MIP/PMI, VA loans have a one-time **funding fee** that goes to the VA to sustain the program.

| Category | Down Payment | First Use | Subsequent Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active/Veteran | 0% | **2.15%** | **3.30%** |
| Active/Veteran | 5-9.99% | 1.50% | 1.50% |
| Active/Veteran | 10%+ | **1.25%** | 1.25% |
| Reserves/Guard | 0% | 2.40% | 3.30% |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The range is **1.25% to 3.30%**. First use with 0% down = 2.15%. Subsequent use with 0% down = 3.30%. Funding fee can be financed into the loan.

**Exemptions from VA Funding Fee:**
- Veterans receiving disability compensation (10%+ disability rating)
- Purple Heart recipients (on active duty)
- Surviving spouses of veterans who died in service or from service-connected disability

---

**VA Entitlement:**

VA entitlement is the amount the VA guarantees on a loan. Understanding entitlement is critical.

**Basic Entitlement:** $36,000 (or 25% of the conforming loan limit in some cases)

**Bonus/Second-Tier Entitlement:** Additional entitlement available when basic is used or for higher-cost loans
- Total entitlement = 25% of the conforming loan limit

**Full Entitlement (post-2020):**
- Veterans with full entitlement have NO loan limit
- Can buy any price home with $0 down and no loan limit
- Full entitlement exists when: No current VA loan, OR previous VA loan was paid off and entitlement restored

**Reduced Entitlement:**
- If a veteran still has an active VA loan, remaining entitlement is reduced
- Veteran may still use remaining entitlement but may need a down payment

**Restoring Entitlement:**
1. Pay off and sell the property (sell and restore)
2. Have an eligible veteran assume the loan
3. One-time restoration: VA allows one restoration even if property still owned

---

**VA IRRRL — Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (Streamline):**
- VA-to-VA refinance with reduced documentation
- No new Certificate of Eligibility typically needed
- No appraisal required (in most cases)
- Must result in lower rate (with some exceptions for ARM-to-fixed)
- Small funding fee (0.5%)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** IRRRL stands for **Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan** — often called the "VA streamline" or "VA IRRRL" (pronounced "Earl"). It's VA-to-VA only.

---

**VA Residual Income:**
Unlike FHA and conventional which focus on DTI, VA underwriting emphasizes **residual income** — the amount of money left over after all monthly obligations.

Minimum residual income varies by:
- Number of family members
- Geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West)
- Loan amount

This is what allows VA loans to be approved with higher DTIs when residual income is strong.

---

### 3. USDA Loans — U.S. Department of Agriculture

**Purpose:**
USDA loans (Rural Development Guaranteed Loan Program) are designed to promote homeownership in rural and certain suburban areas.

**USDA Loan Basics:**

| Feature | USDA Rule |
|---|---|
| **Minimum down payment** | **0%** |
| **Credit score** | Typically 640+ for GUS approval; manual UW available below |
| **Income limits** | **115% of Area Median Income (AMI)** — income limits DO apply |
| **Property location** | Must be in a **USDA-eligible rural area** |
| **Property type** | Primary residence only |
| **Loan limits** | No formal limit (but income-based repayment capacity limits practical maximum) |
| **Assumable** | Yes, with lender approval |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** USDA has **income limits at 115% of AMI**. This is the critical fact that distinguishes USDA — you can earn too MUCH to qualify. This is unique; FHA and VA have no income limits.

---

**USDA Guarantee Fees:**

| Fee | Amount |
|---|---|
| **Upfront Guarantee Fee** | **1.00%** of base loan amount (can be financed) |
| **Annual Fee** | **0.35%** of outstanding balance annually |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** USDA upfront = **1%**. Annual = **0.35%**. Compare to FHA: 1.75% upfront, ~0.55% annual. USDA is significantly cheaper on mortgage insurance.

---

**USDA Property Eligibility:**
- Must be in a USDA-designated rural area (checked at usda.gov)
- Many suburban areas outside major metro areas qualify
- Single-family homes, condos, new construction can qualify
- Property must be in good repair (no major structural issues)
- USDA has its own property standards

**GUS — Guaranteed Underwriting System:**
USDA's version of AUS. Submitting to GUS is required. GUS issues:
- Accept — loan approved through GUS
- Refer — requires manual underwriting
- Refer with Caution — significant issues

### 5. FHA vs. Conventional with PMI — Which Is Better?

**The Break-Even Question:**

FHA advantages:
- Lower credit score accepted
- Lower down payment
- Easier qualifying with higher DTI

Conventional advantages:
- PMI cancels at 78% LTV automatically (or 80% LTV on request)
- No lifetime mortgage insurance requirement
- Often cheaper for borrowers with 680+ credit scores

**Key Rule of Thumb:**
If a borrower with 620-639 credit score and 3-5% down payment can qualify for either:
- FHA: MIP forever (with <10% down)
- Conventional: PMI at ~0.8-1.2% annually, but PMI cancels at 78% LTV

For borrowers who plan to stay long-term, **conventional is often cheaper** once PMI cancels.

### Answer Key

**1. C — 10%.** FHA requires a minimum 10% down payment when the credit score is between 500-579. For scores 580 and above, the minimum is 3.5%. A score of 560 falls in the 500-579 range.

**2. C — 2.15%.** For a first-time use with 0% down, a regular veteran (not Reserves/Guard) pays a VA funding fee of 2.15%.

**3. D — Never — life of the loan.** With a 5% down payment on an FHA loan, the LTV at origination exceeds 90%, meaning MIP will last for the full loan term. MIP only has an 11-year cancellation if the initial down payment was 10% or more.

**4. B — Family with $140,000 income over 115% AMI limit.** USDA income limits are at 115% of Area Median Income. If the area's limit is $125,000 and the family earns $140,000, they exceed the income limit and are ineligible.

**5. B — Apply for restoration of entitlement.** When a veteran pays off a VA loan and sells the property, they need to formally apply to the VA to have their entitlement restored before using it again.

**6. B — PMI will cancel at 78% LTV.** Conventional PMI cancels when LTV reaches 78% (automatically), while FHA MIP with <10% down lasts forever. This is the key long-term advantage of conventional. Note: Conventional DOES have an upfront advantage (no UFMIP), but PMI cancellation is the biggest long-term advantage tested here.

**7. D — 0.35%.** USDA annual guarantee fee is 0.35% of the outstanding balance. The upfront fee is 1.00%.

**8. C — USDA.** Only USDA has geographic restrictions — properties must be in USDA-eligible rural or certain suburban areas. FHA and VA have no geographic restrictions.

**9. C — Residual income.** VA underwriting places primary emphasis on residual income (money left over after all debts), which is why VA allows higher DTIs when residual income is sufficient.

**10. B — 11 years.** With exactly 10% down, the FHA loan starts at 90% LTV. MIP cancels after 11 years (if LTV is at or below 90% at origination and the borrower put 10% or more down). This is the threshold — below 10% = life of loan; 10% or more = 11 years.
