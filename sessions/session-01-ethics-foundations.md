## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### What the Exam Tests on Ethics

The ethics section covers **how MLOs must behave** — both the rules that govern you and the actions that will get your license revoked or land you in legal trouble.

---

### 1. The SAFE Act & NMLS

**SAFE Act (Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act — 2008)**
- Created a **nationwide licensing system** for MLOs → NMLS
- Required ALL MLOs to register or be licensed
- Background checks, credit checks, education requirements
- **Bank employees** → register (not license) with NMLS
- **Non-bank MLOs** (brokers, independent lenders) → must be **state-licensed**

**NMLS Requirements to Get Licensed:**
- 20 hours of pre-licensing education
  - 3 hrs federal law
  - 3 hrs ethics (fraud, consumer protection, fair lending)
  - 2 hrs non-traditional mortgage products
  - 12 hrs electives
- Pass the SAFE exam (75%+)
- Background check + credit check
- Surety bond (amount varies by state)

**Annual Renewal:**
- 8 hours of continuing education (CE)
  - 3 hrs federal law
  - 2 hrs ethics
  - 2 hrs non-traditional mortgage products
  - 1 hr elective

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The SAFE Act created the NMLS. Bank employees REGISTER. Non-bank MLOs get LICENSED. This distinction comes up.

### 2. Prohibited Acts (KNOW THESE COLD)

| Prohibited Act | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Steering** | Directing a borrower to a loan that isn't in their best interest (e.g., higher rate because YOU get more commission) |
| **Redlining** | Refusing to lend in certain geographic areas based on race/ethnicity |
| **Reverse redlining** | Targeting minority neighborhoods with predatory loan products |
| **Bait and switch** | Advertising one rate/product, then switching to worse terms at closing |
| **Kickbacks** | Accepting or paying for loan referrals (RESPA §8 violation) |
| **Misrepresentation** | Falsifying or omitting material information on a loan application |
| **Churning** | Repeatedly refinancing a borrower just to generate fees |

---

### 3. Fair Lending Laws

**Fair Housing Act — 7 Protected Classes:**
1. Race
2. Color
3. National Origin
4. Religion
5. Sex
6. Familial Status (families with children under 18, pregnant women)
7. Handicap/Disability

**ECOA — Additional Protected Classes:**
- Age
- Marital Status
- Receipt of public assistance income
- Exercise of rights under Consumer Protection Act

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Fair Housing = 7 classes. ECOA adds age, marital status, income source. Both laws can apply to mortgage transactions.

---

### 4. MLO Advertising Ethics

Must include on ALL advertising:
- Your **NMLS ID number**
- Your **company name** as registered

Cannot do:
- Advertise rates without proper disclosures (Reg Z triggers)
- Use the word "free" for something that isn't
- Imply government affiliation (e.g., "FHA-approved lender" misleadingly)
- Omit required disclosures triggered by a specific rate mention

---

### 5. Financial Responsibility

- Self-report any criminal conviction within 30 days
- Self-report any financial event (bankruptcy, judgment) within 30 days
