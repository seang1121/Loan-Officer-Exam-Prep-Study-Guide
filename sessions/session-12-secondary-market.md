## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

The secondary market is how mortgage lending works at scale. Understanding the GSEs, conforming vs. non-conforming loans, MBS, and the flow of money from borrower to investor is foundational knowledge for any mortgage professional. Expect 8-12 questions on this material.

---

### 1. Primary vs. Secondary Market

**Primary Market:**
Where mortgage loans are **originated** — the transaction between the lender and the borrower.
- MLO takes the application
- Lender underwrites and funds the loan
- Borrower receives the mortgage

**Secondary Market:**
Where **existing mortgage loans** are bought and sold after origination.
- Lenders sell funded loans to investors
- Lenders receive cash to fund new loans
- Investors earn interest income from mortgage payments
- Creates liquidity for the mortgage market

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The primary market = origination (lender ↔ borrower). The secondary market = where loans are sold/traded after they're made (lender → investor). The secondary market is what allows lenders to keep making new loans.

**Why the Secondary Market Exists:**
- **Liquidity:** Without it, lenders would run out of money to make new loans
- **Rate standardization:** Creates uniform guidelines that result in consistent pricing
- **Risk distribution:** Spreads mortgage risk across many investors
- **Access:** Allows smaller lenders to participate in mortgage lending

### 2. Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs)

The "Big Three" secondary market players:

---

**Fannie Mae — FNMA (Federal National Mortgage Association)**

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Founded** | 1938 (New Deal) |
| **Privately owned** | Yes (shares traded before conservatorship) |
| **Regulated by** | FHFA |
| **What it does** | Buys conventional conforming loans from lenders |
| **How it funds purchases** | Issues mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and debt |
| **Current status** | In FHFA conservatorship since 2008 |

- Purchases **conforming conventional loans** (loans meeting Fannie's guidelines)
- Does NOT lend directly to consumers
- Sets underwriting guidelines (credit, LTV, DTI, documentation)
- AUS: **Desktop Underwriter (DU)**

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Fannie Mae = FNMA = buys conventional conforming loans. DU is Fannie's AUS.

---

**Freddie Mac — FHLMC (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation)**

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Founded** | 1970 |
| **Privately owned** | Yes (shares traded before conservatorship) |
| **Regulated by** | FHFA |
| **What it does** | Buys conventional conforming loans from lenders |
| **Current status** | In FHFA conservatorship since 2008 |

- Same basic function as Fannie Mae — creates competition
- Purchases **conforming conventional loans**
- AUS: **Loan Product Advisor (LPA)**
- Also issues MBS

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Fannie and Freddie do essentially the same thing (buy conforming conventional loans) but are separate entities — they create competition between each other. Freddie = LPA.

**Fannie vs. Freddie — Key Differences:**
- Different underwriting guidelines (details matter for individual loan types)
- Different AUS systems (DU vs. LPA)
- Can approve some loans the other won't
- Mortgage bankers submit to both to find the best terms

---

**Ginnie Mae — GNMA (Government National Mortgage Association)**

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Founded** | 1968 |
| **Government owned** | Yes — part of HUD |
| **What it does** | Guarantees MBS backed by government loans |
| **Loans it guarantees** | FHA, VA, USDA, HUD Section 184 loans |
| **Does it buy loans?** | **NO** — it only guarantees, doesn't purchase |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — BIGGEST EXAM TRAP:** Ginnie Mae does **NOT buy loans**. It **guarantees** mortgage-backed securities backed by government loans (FHA, VA, USDA). Fannie and Freddie BUY loans. Ginnie GUARANTEES MBS. Do not mix these up.

---

**GSE Comparison Table:**

| Entity | Loans Dealt With | Buys Loans? | Guarantees MBS? | AUS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **FNMA (Fannie Mae)** | Conventional conforming | **Yes** | Yes | DU |
| **FHLMC (Freddie Mac)** | Conventional conforming | **Yes** | Yes | LPA |
| **GNMA (Ginnie Mae)** | FHA, VA, USDA | **No** | **Yes** | N/A |

### 3. FHFA — Federal Housing Finance Agency

**What Is FHFA?**
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is the regulatory and supervisory agency for:
- Fannie Mae (FNMA)
- Freddie Mac (FHLMC)
- The 11 Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs)

**Key FHFA Functions:**
- Sets **conforming loan limits** annually (based on home price changes)
- Placed Fannie and Freddie into **conservatorship in 2008** during the financial crisis
- Sets capital requirements for GSEs
- Oversees safety and soundness of the housing finance system

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** FHFA = regulates Fannie, Freddie, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. HUD ≠ FHFA. HUD oversees FHA and Ginnie Mae.

---

### 4. Conforming vs. Non-Conforming Loans

**Conforming Loans:**
Loans that meet all guidelines set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac:
- Loan amount ≤ conforming loan limit
- Meet credit, LTV, DTI, and documentation requirements
- Can be purchased by FNMA or FHLMC

**Conforming Loan Limits (2024):**
- **Standard:** $766,550 for a single-unit property
- **High-cost areas:** Up to $1,149,825 (150% of standard)
- 2-unit: Different (higher) limits
- 3-unit: Different (higher) limits
- 4-unit: Different (higher) limits
- Limits increase annually based on FHFA home price index

**Non-Conforming Loans:**
Any loan that doesn't meet Fannie/Freddie guidelines — cannot be sold to GSEs:
- **Jumbo loans** (exceed conforming limits)
- **Alt-A or non-QM loans** (don't meet credit/documentation standards)
- **Government loans** (FHA, VA, USDA — these go through Ginnie Mae, not FNMA/FHLMC)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** "Non-conforming" doesn't automatically mean bad or predatory — a jumbo loan for a wealthy borrower is non-conforming simply because of size.

---

### 5. Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)

**What Is an MBS?**
A mortgage-backed security is a financial instrument backed by a pool of mortgages. Investors buy MBS and receive payments derived from the underlying mortgage payments.

**How MBS Work:**
1. Lenders originate hundreds of loans
2. Loans are pooled together
3. Pool is "securitized" — converted into securities
4. Securities are sold to investors (pension funds, insurance companies, foreign governments)
5. Investors receive monthly principal and interest payments from the pool

**Benefits of Securitization:**
- **For lenders:** They receive cash immediately (instead of waiting 30 years for payments)
- **For investors:** Predictable income stream backed by real assets
- **For the market:** Creates liquidity, keeps mortgage rates relatively low

**Pass-Through Securities:**
The most common MBS structure — investors receive their proportional share of all payments (principal and interest) as they come in.

**Tranches (CMOs):**
Collateralized Mortgage Obligations divide MBS into different risk/return levels (tranches) to attract different investor types.

---

### 6. The Securitization Process

```
Step 1: ORIGINATION
    Lender makes mortgage loan to borrower
         ↓
Step 2: AGGREGATION  
    Lender accumulates hundreds of similar loans
         ↓
Step 3: POOLING
    Loans are placed in a trust/pool
         ↓
Step 4: SECURITIZATION
    Pool issues MBS certificates to investors
         ↓
Step 5: DISTRIBUTION
    MBS sold to investors (pension funds, insurance companies, etc.)
         ↓
Step 6: ONGOING SERVICING
    Servicer collects payments, sends to investors
```

---

### 7. Portfolio Loans

**What Is a Portfolio Loan?**
A loan that a lender keeps on its own books rather than selling to the secondary market.

**Characteristics:**
- More flexible underwriting (lender sets own criteria)
- Can accommodate unusual borrowers/properties that don't fit FNMA/FHLMC boxes
- Higher rates (lender takes full risk)
- Examples: Jumbo loans, loans to self-employed with complex finances, unique properties

**Why Lenders Portfolio Loans:**
- Higher profit potential (don't share with investors)
- Relationship banking (serve valued customers)
- Meet CRA obligations
- Unique products they can't sell to GSEs

---

### 8. Warehouse Lending

**What Is Warehouse Lending?**
A short-term line of credit that mortgage bankers and independent lenders use to fund loans before selling them to the secondary market.

**How It Works:**
1. Lender establishes a warehouse line with a commercial bank
2. When a loan closes, the warehouse bank funds it (advances money)
3. The closed loan sits in the "warehouse" (pledged as collateral for the line)
4. When the loan is sold to a secondary market investor, the advance is repaid
5. The line is now available to fund the next loan

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Warehouse lending is how most mortgage bankers and non-bank lenders actually FUND loans between origination and sale to investors. Without it, they'd need massive capital reserves.

**Warehouse Line Risk:**
If a lender cannot sell loans quickly (e.g., secondary market disruption), loans pile up in the warehouse and may trigger margin calls or line of credit issues.

---

### 9. Servicing Rights

**What Is Mortgage Servicing?**
Servicing = the right to collect payments from borrowers and administer the loan on behalf of the owner.

**Servicer Responsibilities:**
- Collect monthly payments
- Manage escrow accounts (taxes, insurance)
- Apply payments to principal and interest
- Handle delinquency and loss mitigation
- Report to investors (MBS holders)
- Communicate with borrowers

**Servicing Rights (MSRs — Mortgage Servicing Rights):**
- The right to service a loan has monetary value
- Can be bought and sold separately from the loan itself
- Servicer earns a **servicing fee** (typically 0.25-0.50% of balance annually)

**When Servicing Transfers:**
- Borrower must be notified (RESPA requirement)
- 15 days before transfer: Notice from current servicer
- 15 days after transfer: Notice from new servicer
- 60-day grace period: No penalty for sending payment to old servicer

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** "The sale of your loan does NOT mean your payment obligation changes." Also — the servicing can be sold WITHOUT the loan, and the loan can be sold WITHOUT the servicing. They're separate rights.

---

### 10. Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs)

**What Are FHLBs?**
A network of 11 regional banks established in 1932 that provide liquidity to their member institutions.

**Members:** Commercial banks, credit unions, savings institutions, insurance companies

**How They Work:**
- Members can borrow from their FHLB at favorable rates
- Advances (loans) from FHLB are used to fund mortgages
- Collateralized by mortgage loans and other assets

**Regulated by:** FHFA (same as Fannie and Freddie)

### Answer Key

**1. C — Ginnie Mae (GNMA).** Ginnie Mae guarantees MBS backed by government loans (FHA, VA, USDA) but does NOT purchase the loans. Fannie and Freddie purchase loans. FHFA regulates the GSEs.

**2. B — Non-conforming.** $900,000 exceeds the standard conforming loan limit of $766,550. In standard-cost areas, any loan above $766,550 is a jumbo/non-conforming loan. (Note: In high-cost areas, it might be conforming.)

**3. C — FHFA.** The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) regulates Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks. HUD regulates FHA and Ginnie Mae.

**4. B — A warehouse line of credit.** This is precisely how mortgage bankers operate — they use warehouse lines to fund loans, then repay the line when they sell the loans to investors.

**5. B — No — 60-day grace period.** RESPA provides a 60-day protection period after a servicing transfer. During this time, no late fees or penalties can be charged for sending payment to the previous servicer.

**6. B — Ginnie Mae is government-owned; Fannie Mae is a privately-held GSE.** Ginnie Mae is a government corporation (within HUD). Fannie Mae is a GSE in conservatorship (privately chartered). Both are in government conservatorship now, but Ginnie was always government-owned.

**7. B — Liquidity for lenders.** Securitization's primary benefit to the housing market is creating liquidity — lenders receive cash when they sell loans, allowing them to fund new mortgages continuously.

**8. B — The $550,000 conventional loan.** Only conventional conforming loans meeting FHLMC guidelines can be purchased by Freddie Mac. Jumbo loans exceed the conforming limit; FHA and VA loans go through Ginnie Mae, not Freddie.

**9. B — Mortgage banker/correspondent lender.** A mortgage banker originates loans using their own capital (including warehouse lines) and sells them to the secondary market. They're different from brokers (who don't fund) and portfolio lenders (who keep loans).

**10. C — Servicer.** When a lender sells a loan but continues collecting payments on behalf of the new owner (Fannie Mae), they're acting as the loan servicer. Servicing is a separate function from loan ownership.
