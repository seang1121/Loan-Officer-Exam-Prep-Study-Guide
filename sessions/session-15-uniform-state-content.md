## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

The Uniform State Content (USC) portion of the SAFE exam tests your knowledge of NMLS licensing requirements, prohibited conduct, and state regulatory oversight. About 11% of the exam (roughly 14 questions) focuses here. These are often "easy points" if you know the rules cold.

### 1. NMLS — National Mortgage Licensing System

**What Is NMLS?**
The National Mortgage Licensing System and Registry (NMLS) is the centralized licensing system for the mortgage industry in the United States, created by the SAFE Act (2008).

**NMLS Functions:**
- Processes state license applications for MLOs
- Stores licensing information (unique NMLS ID number)
- Tracks continuing education completion
- Processes background checks and credit reports
- Allows consumers to look up any licensed MLO
- Receives quarterly Mortgage Call Reports from companies

**NMLS ID Number:**
Every licensed/registered MLO receives a **unique NMLS ID number** that:
- Stays with the MLO for their career (never changes)
- Must be disclosed on all loan documents, business cards, and advertising
- Allows consumers to verify credentials at nmlsconsumeraccess.org

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The NMLS ID number is permanent — it follows the MLO for life. You don't get a new number if you change employers or states.

---

### 2. Initial Licensing Requirements

**Pre-Licensing Education:**
Before applying for a state license, an MLO must complete **20 hours** of NMLS-approved pre-licensing education (PE):

| Requirement | Hours |
|---|---|
| Federal law | 3 hours |
| Ethics (fraud, consumer protection, fair lending) | 3 hours |
| Non-traditional mortgage lending | 2 hours |
| Electives | 12 hours |
| **Total** | **20 hours** |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **20 hours PE** = 3 federal + 3 ethics + 2 non-trad + 12 elective. This exact breakdown is tested.

**The SAFE Exam:**
- Must pass with a score of **75% or higher**
- 125 questions (25 are pre-test/unscored, though you don't know which)
- 190 minutes
- Taken at a Prometric testing center
- Includes both National and State components
- **Waiting periods after failure:**
  - Failed once: 30-day waiting period
  - Failed twice: 30-day waiting period  
  - Failed three times: **180-day waiting period**

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** After the 3rd failed attempt, must wait **180 days** (6 months) before testing again.

**Background Check:**
- FBI fingerprint-based criminal background check through NMLS
- Credit check required
- Must disclose felony convictions (and misdemeanors involving fraud, dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering)

**Credit Check:**
- Financial responsibility is required
- A poor credit history doesn't automatically disqualify (but must demonstrate financial responsibility)
- Ongoing obligation to maintain good financial standing

**Surety Bond:**
- Required in most states
- Amount varies by state and origination volume
- Protects consumers from MLO misconduct

---

### 3. Disqualifying Factors

**Automatic Disqualifiers:**

| Disqualifying Event | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Felony involving fraud, dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering** | **Permanent bar** — can never be licensed |
| **Other felony conviction** | **7-year bar** from conviction or release from prison (whichever is later) |
| **License revoked in any state** | Must disclose; may bar licensure in other states |
| **Specific misdemeanors** | Some states bar for misdemeanor fraud/dishonesty convictions |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** A felony involving **fraud or dishonesty** = **PERMANENT bar**. A DUI felony = 7-year bar (not permanent, because it's not fraud-related). This distinction is critical.

**Financial Disqualifiers (not automatic, but considered):**
- Outstanding judgments or liens
- Delinquent child support
- Unresolved credit issues
- Past financial fraud

---

### 4. License Maintenance — Annual Renewal

**Continuing Education (CE) Requirements:**
MLOs must complete **8 hours** of CE annually to renew their license:

| Requirement | Hours |
|---|---|
| Federal law | 3 hours |
| Ethics (fraud, consumer protection, fair lending) | 2 hours |
| Non-traditional mortgage lending | 2 hours |
| Elective | 1 hour |
| **Total** | **8 hours** |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Renewal = **8 hours CE** = 3 federal + 2 ethics + 2 non-trad + 1 elective. Compare to initial 20 hours PE (3+3+2+12).

**Annual Renewal Requirements:**
- Complete 8 hours CE
- Pay renewal fees
- Update NMLS record with any changes
- Background check may be refreshed (varies by state)
- License expiration date: Typically December 31 of each year
- Renewal deadline: Typically November 30 (to ensure license is active January 1)

**Self-Reporting Obligation:**
MLOs must self-report to their state(s) and update their NMLS record within **30 days** of:
- Changes to contact information
- Criminal convictions (even if appealing)
- Civil judgments against them
- Administrative actions in other states
- Bankruptcy filing

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **30 days** to self-report material changes to NMLS. This includes criminal charges — even if not yet convicted, and even if you plan to appeal.

---

### 5. License Statuses

**Active License:** MLO is licensed and in good standing; can originate loans

**Inactive License:** License exists but MLO is not currently originating (not affiliated with a licensed company)
- Cannot originate loans while inactive
- Must reactivate before originating

**Expired License:** MLO failed to renew; cannot originate loans
- **Late renewal period:** Some states allow renewal for 30-60 days after expiration with penalty
- Beyond late period: May need to retake exam

**License Surrender:** MLO voluntarily gives up license
- Must still complete pending transactions
- May affect future licensing applications (must disclose)
- Different from revocation — voluntary vs. involuntary

**License Revocation:** State takes the license away for cause
- Most serious consequence
- Must be disclosed on all future NMLS applications
- May affect ability to obtain licenses in other states

**License Suspension:** Temporary removal of licensing authority
- Temporary — may be reinstated after conditions are met
- Cannot originate during suspension

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Know the difference between surrender (voluntary) and revocation (involuntary for cause). Both must be disclosed.

---

### 6. Supervision and Examination

**State Regulator Authority:**
State mortgage regulators have broad authority to:
- Examine MLO and company records
- Interview employees, including MLOs
- Issue subpoenas for documents and testimony
- Access all business records related to mortgage activity
- Enter business premises for examination

**What Regulators Can Examine:**
- Loan files
- Financial records
- Employment records
- Communications with borrowers
- Advertising and marketing materials
- NMLS information and compliance

**Examination Frequency:**
- Varies by state
- Risk-based: Problematic companies examined more often
- Typically annual or bi-annual for licensed entities

**Cooperation Required:**
MLOs and companies must cooperate fully with state examinations. Refusing to provide documents or obstructing an examination is itself a serious violation.

---

### 7. Prohibited Acts Under State Law

While specific prohibited acts vary by state, there are common prohibitions found in most state mortgage statutes:

| Prohibited Act | Description |
|---|---|
| **False statements on application** | Lying on a license application or any mortgage document |
| **Misrepresenting loan terms** | Telling a borrower something false about their loan |
| **Unlicensed activity** | Originating loans without a valid license |
| **Failure to disclose fees** | Not disclosing compensation or fees charged |
| **Bait and switch** | Advertising one rate/product, delivering different terms |
| **Steering** | Directing borrowers to unsuitable products for personal gain |
| **Fraud** | Any intentional deception in connection with a mortgage transaction |
| **Coercion** | Pressuring a borrower to accept specific terms |
| **Unlawful discrimination** | Violating ECOA, Fair Housing, or state civil rights laws |
| **Excessive fees** | Charging unreasonable or unauthorized fees |

---

### 8. Mortgage Call Reports

**What Are They?**
Mortgage Call Reports (MCR) are quarterly financial reports that licensed mortgage companies must file through NMLS.

**Filing Requirements:**
- Filed **quarterly** (not annually) through NMLS
- Companies (not individual MLOs) file MCRs
- Two parts:
  - **Residential Mortgage Loan Activity (RMLA):** Loan production data
  - **Financial Condition (FC):** Financial statement data

**What MCRs Report:**
- Number of applications received
- Loans originated, purchased, sold
- Loans by type (FHA, VA, conventional, etc.)
- Warehouse line balances
- Net worth, assets, liabilities

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** MCRs are filed **quarterly** by companies (not individual MLOs). Many candidates confuse this with annual reporting.

---

### 9. Net Worth Requirements and Surety Bonds

**Net Worth Requirements:**
- Some states require licensed mortgage companies to maintain minimum net worth
- Varies by state and license type
- Purpose: Ensure financial stability of the company
- Individual MLOs typically don't have separate net worth requirements (the company does)

**Surety Bond:**
- A three-party agreement (obligee = state, principal = MLO/company, surety = bond company)
- Protects consumers from financial harm due to MLO misconduct
- If an MLO violates the law and a consumer suffers loss, they can file a claim against the bond
- Bond amount typically scales with origination volume
- The MLO (or company) must reimburse the surety company if a claim is paid

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** A surety bond protects **consumers**, not the MLO. The bond is NOT insurance for the MLO.

---

### 10. Moving Between States

**Relocating to a New State:**
When an MLO moves or wants to originate loans in an additional state:
- Must apply for a NEW state license in that state through NMLS
- Same NMLS ID number is used (it follows you forever)
- Must meet the new state's licensing requirements
- May need to take a state-specific exam component
- Some states have reciprocity agreements

**Interstate Licensing:**
- Some states have **reciprocity** — honor another state's requirements partially
- No universal reciprocity exists across all states
- Each state has its own requirements even if similar

**While Transitioning:**
- An MLO actively licensed in one state who moves to another cannot originate in the new state until licensed there
- Cannot originate loans in a state where they are NOT licensed

---

### 11. Branch Licensing

**Branch Office Requirements:**
- Some states require a separate license or registration for each branch office
- Branch manager may need their own license
- Branch records are subject to state examination just like the home office

---

### 12. Record Retention Requirements

**Federal Requirements:**
- RESPA: Lenders must retain loan files for **3 years** after closing
- ECOA: Adverse action records retained **25 months** (2 years + 1 month)
- HMDA: LAR data retained for **3 years**
- BSA: 5 years for CTR/SAR records

**State Requirements:**
- Most states require **3-5 years** of records
- Some states require records through the life of the loan plus a period after payoff
- Electronic records generally acceptable

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The general rule for state record retention is **3-5 years**. Federal: RESPA = 3 years, ECOA adverse action = 25 months, BSA = 5 years.

### Answer Key

**1. B — Yes, the 7-year bar has passed.** Assault (not involving fraud, dishonesty, or breach of trust) triggers a 7-year bar from conviction or release. At 8 years, the bar has expired, and the applicant may be eligible — subject to state discretion and other factors.

**2. C — Permanently barred.** Wire fraud in connection with a mortgage scheme involves fraud and dishonesty. Any felony conviction involving fraud, dishonesty, breach of trust, or money laundering results in a **permanent bar** from obtaining an MLO license.

**3. B — PE: 3 hours federal, CE: 3 hours federal.** Both pre-licensing education and annual continuing education require 3 hours of federal law content. (Ethics differs: PE = 3 hours, CE = 2 hours.)

**4. B — 30 days.** MLOs must self-report material changes (including bankruptcy) to their state regulator within 30 days through NMLS.

**5. B — Quarterly.** Mortgage Call Reports (MCRs) are filed quarterly by licensed mortgage companies through NMLS.

**6. D — 180 days.** After the 3rd failed SAFE exam attempt, the candidate must wait 180 days (6 months) before testing again.

**7. B — Surrender must be disclosed on future applications.** Any surrender, revocation, expiration under investigation, or other adverse licensing history must be disclosed on future NMLS applications. Surrendering doesn't erase the history or stop ongoing investigations.

**8. C — Subpoena can be issued; refusal may be a violation.** State mortgage regulators have broad examination authority. If an MLO refuses to cooperate, the regulator can issue a subpoena. The refusal itself may constitute a separate violation of state mortgage law.

**9. B — Apply for new Texas license with same NMLS ID.** Each state requires its own license. The MLO uses the same NMLS ID number but must submit a new application and meet Texas-specific requirements.

**10. C — 25 months.** ECOA (Regulation B) requires adverse action records be retained for 25 months from the date of the action. This is a specific, commonly tested number.
