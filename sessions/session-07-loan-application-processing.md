## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

The application and processing section tests your practical knowledge of the mortgage process. Questions focus on what triggers a complete application, how to calculate income and DTI, and how to verify assets. Expect 15-20 questions from this area.

---

### 1. Uniform Residential Loan Application (URLA / Form 1003)

**What It Is:**
The Uniform Residential Loan Application — commonly called the **1003** (pronounced "ten-oh-three") — is the standard application form used for all residential mortgage loans. Updated by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the new URLA became mandatory in 2021.

**Sections of the 1003:**

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **Section 1** | Borrower information (name, SSN, DOB, contact) |
| **Section 2** | Financial information — employment |
| **Section 3** | Financial information — income and employment |
| **Section 4** | Financial information — assets and liabilities |
| **Section 5** | Financial information — real estate owned |
| **Section 6** | Loan and property information |
| **Section 7** | Military service (VA eligibility) |
| **Section 8** | Demographic information (race, ethnicity, sex — for HMDA) |
| **Section 9** | Loan originator information |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Know that the 1003 collects demographic information (Section 8) for **HMDA reporting purposes** — not to make lending decisions.

### 2. The 6 TRID Application Triggers (Complete Application)

Under TRID (RESPA/TILA), a **complete application** is triggered when the lender receives ALL of the following **6 pieces of information**. Once received, the Loan Estimate (LE) must be delivered within **3 business days**.

| # | Trigger Element |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Borrower's name** |
| 2 | **Borrower's income** |
| 3 | **Borrower's Social Security Number** (to pull credit) |
| 4 | **Property address** |
| 5 | **Estimated value of the property** |
| 6 | **Loan amount sought** |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — MEMORIZE THESE 6:** The mnemonic is **"NISSAL"** or **"NI PAVE L"**: Name, Income, SSN, Property address, Assessed/estimated value, Loan amount. As soon as all 6 are received, the lender has 3 business days to send the LE.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** A lender CANNOT delay sending the LE by asking for additional information not on this list. Once the 6 items are received, the 3-day clock starts.

---

### 3. Income Types and How They're Calculated

**Base Salary / Hourly Wages:**
- Used directly — most straightforward income type
- Verified with pay stubs (most recent 30 days) and W-2s (2 years)
- Part-time income may need a 2-year history

---

**Overtime and Bonus Income:**
- Must have a **2-year history** of receiving the income
- Calculated as a **2-year average** (total from last 2 years ÷ 24 months)
- Must be likely to continue (employer must confirm likelihood)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Overtime and bonuses require a **2-year history** and are averaged. A borrower who just started receiving overtime this year cannot count it.

---

**Commission Income:**
- If commission income is **25% or more** of total income → treated like self-employed
- Must have 2-year history
- Calculated as 2-year average
- Significant decline in commission income is a red flag

---

**Self-Employment Income:**
- Defined as owning **25% or more** of a business
- Must provide **2 years of personal tax returns** (AND 2 years of business tax returns for partnerships/S-corps/LLCs)
- Income is calculated using **Schedule C, E, or F** depending on business structure
- Lenders look at: Net profit + depreciation + depletion - business use of home - non-recurring income/losses
- Declining self-employment income trend can trigger denial or additional documentation

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **25% ownership = self-employed** for mortgage purposes. Even a W-2 employee who owns 25%+ of a business must provide business tax returns.

**Self-Employment Income Calculation:**
```
Conventional/FHA: Average of 2 years adjusted income
If year 2 income significantly lower than year 1 → use year 2 only
If income is declining → lender may not use self-employment income
```

---

**Rental Income:**
- Only **75%** of gross rent is counted (25% vacancy/expense factor)
- Must have a history of receiving rent (usually 1-2 years documented on tax returns)
- New rental: Appraiser can use market rent in some cases
- Rental income from primary residence (renting rooms): generally not counted by conventional lenders

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Rental income = **75% of gross** — this is directly tested. If a borrower receives $2,000/month rent, only $1,500 counts toward qualifying income.

---

**Social Security / Disability / Pension:**
- Counted at full face value
- Can be "grossed up" by 25% if not taxable (makes qualifying easier)
- Example: $2,000/month SS × 125% = $2,500 for qualifying

---

**Alimony / Child Support:**
- Counted as income IF borrower chooses to disclose AND it has a documented history
- Must be likely to continue for at least 3 years from closing date
- Verified with divorce decree and bank statements showing receipt

---

**Income NOT Counted:**
- One-time bonuses (not recurring)
- Gambling winnings (not regular income)
- Gifts (these are assets, not income)
- Future, speculative income

---

### 4. DTI — Debt-to-Income Ratio

**The Most Important Underwriting Ratio:**

DTI measures how much of a borrower's gross monthly income goes to debt payments.

**Front-End DTI (Housing Ratio):**
```
Front-End DTI = PITI / Gross Monthly Income

PITI = Principal + Interest + Property Taxes + Homeowners Insurance
(+ HOA dues, mortgage insurance if applicable)
```

**Back-End DTI (Total DTI):**
```
Back-End DTI = (All Monthly Debts + PITI) / Gross Monthly Income

Monthly debts include: credit card minimums, car loans, student loans, 
personal loans, alimony, child support
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Monthly salary: $6,000 gross
- PITI: $1,500
- Car payment: $400
- Minimum credit card: $100
- Student loan: $200

```
Front-End DTI = $1,500 / $6,000 = 25%
Back-End DTI = ($1,500 + $400 + $100 + $200) / $6,000 = $2,200 / $6,000 = 36.7%
```

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** When the exam says "DTI" without specifying, they usually mean **back-end (total) DTI**.

---

**DTI Limits by Loan Type:**

| Loan Type | Max Front-End DTI | Max Back-End DTI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Conventional** | 28% (guideline) | 45-50% | DU/LPA may approve higher |
| **FHA** | 31% (guideline) | 43% | Up to 57% with strong compensating factors |
| **VA** | No limit | 41% (guideline) | Residual income may allow higher |
| **USDA** | 29% | 41% | |
| **QM (General)** | No federal limit | **43%** | Hard cap for General QM |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** FHA allows higher DTI with compensating factors — sometimes up to 57%. VA's primary measure is **residual income**, not DTI. QM's hard cap is **43%** back-end DTI.

---

**Compensating Factors for High DTI (FHA):**
- Large down payment (10%+)
- Large cash reserves (3+ months PITI)
- Minimal housing payment increase
- Residual income
- Minimal discretionary debt

---

### 5. Assets — Sourcing and Seasoning

**Types of Assets Counted:**
- Checking and savings accounts
- Retirement accounts (401k, IRA) — typically 60% of vested balance for conventional
- Stocks, bonds, mutual funds — typically 70% of value (to account for market fluctuation)
- Gift funds
- Proceeds from sale of assets

---

**Sourcing:**
All assets used for down payment and closing costs must be "sourced" — lenders must verify where the money came from.

- Why: Prevent undisclosed loans, money laundering, borrowed funds
- How: Bank statements (typically last 2-3 months), VODs (Verification of Deposit)
- Any large deposit (typically more than 25% of gross monthly income) must be explained

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Any large unexplained deposit triggers a "source of funds" requirement. The lender needs a paper trail.

---

**Seasoning:**
Funds that have been in the borrower's account for a sufficient period are considered "seasoned."

- **60 days in account** = generally considered seasoned (doesn't need additional sourcing)
- A gift received before the 60-day window and already in the account may be considered seasoned

---

**Gift Funds:**
- Conventional: Gift from a "related person" — family member (parents, sibling, spouse, etc.)
- FHA: Gifts from family, employer, or charitable organization
- USDA: Similar to FHA
- VA: Similar to FHA
- Requirements: Gift letter stating it's not a loan, no repayment expected; documentation of transfer

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Gift funds for a mortgage MUST be accompanied by a **gift letter** stating no repayment is expected. Otherwise it's treated as a loan and counted as a liability.

---

**Retirement Account Assets:**
- Conventional: **60% of vested balance** (accounts for tax and early withdrawal penalty)
- FHA: May use 60% or 100% depending on whether funds are actually being withdrawn

---

### 6. LTV and CLTV

**Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV):**
```
LTV = Loan Amount / Appraised Value (or Purchase Price, whichever is lower)
```

**Example:**
- Purchase price: $300,000
- Appraised value: $295,000
- Loan amount: $240,000
- LTV = $240,000 / $295,000 = 81.4% (use lower of purchase price or appraised value)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** LTV uses the **lower** of purchase price or appraised value. If the appraisal comes in low, the borrower may need to put more money down.

---

**Combined Loan-to-Value Ratio (CLTV):**
```
CLTV = (All Liens Combined) / Appraised Value
```

**Example:**
- 1st mortgage: $200,000
- HELOC (2nd lien): $30,000
- Appraised value: $300,000
- CLTV = ($200,000 + $30,000) / $300,000 = 76.7%

---

**High-Ratio Loans:**
- LTV > 80% typically requires PMI for conventional loans
- FHA: MIP required regardless of LTV

---

### 7. The Processing Phase

**What Happens After Application:**

| Step | Who Does It | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Credit pull** | Processor/MLO | Pull tri-merge credit report |
| **Ordering appraisal** | Lender (through AMC) | Independent appraisal ordered |
| **Verification of Employment (VOE)** | Processor | Confirm employment with employer |
| **Verification of Deposit (VOD)** | Processor | Confirm bank balances with institution |
| **Title search** | Title company | Check for liens, encumbrances |
| **Flood certification** | Third party | Determine if in flood zone |
| **Mortgage insurance application** | Lender | Apply for PMI/MIP if needed |
| **File submission** | Processor → Underwriter | Submit complete loan package |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The **MLO cannot select or contact the appraiser directly** — this is an AIR (Appraiser Independence Requirements) rule. The lender orders through an AMC (Appraisal Management Company) or an approved panel.

---

**Processor vs. Underwriter:**
- **Processor:** Gathers and organizes documents, verifies information, prepares loan file for submission
- **Underwriter:** Makes the credit decision — approves, denies, or suspends the loan
- Processors work for lenders and deal in data; underwriters make judgments

---

### Quick Reference: Income Calculation Rules

| Income Type | Minimum History | How Calculated |
|---|---|---|
| Base salary | None (new job OK) | Gross monthly salary |
| Overtime/bonus | 2 years | 2-year average |
| Commission (>25% of income) | 2 years | 2-year average |
| Self-employed (25%+ ownership) | 2 years | Adjusted net income (tax returns) |
| Rental income | 1-2 years | 75% of gross rent |
| Social Security | N/A | Full amount (can gross up if non-taxable) |
| Alimony/child support | 6 months received | Full amount (3+ years must continue) |

### Answer Key

**1. B — No, still needs property address and estimated value.** All 6 TRID triggers must be present for a complete application: Name, Income, SSN, Property address, Estimated value, and Loan amount. She's missing property address and estimated value.

**2. B — Self-employed.** Wait — actually this is a trick question. Commission income ≥25% of TOTAL income means she's treated as a commission employee requiring 2-year average, not technically "self-employed." Self-employed means 25% ownership of a business. The answer should be: her commission income (2,000 out of 6,000 = 33%) triggers the 2-year average requirement for commission income. Answer B is the closest — the commission income must be averaged. 

**Note for exam:** COMMISSION exceeding 25% of income → 2-year average required. BUSINESS OWNERSHIP of 25%+ → self-employed documentation (tax returns). These are slightly different scenarios.

**3. C — $1,350 (75%).** The standard rule is 75% of gross rental income. $1,800 × 0.75 = $1,350.

**4. D — 40%.** Total monthly debts = PITI $1,800 + car $500 + student loan $300 + credit card $200 = $2,800. Back-end DTI = $2,800 / $7,000... Wait: $2,800 / $8,000 = 35%. Let me recalculate: $1,800 + $500 + $300 + $200 = $2,800. $2,800 / $8,000 = 35%. Answer is **C — 35%**.

**5. C — 80%.** LTV uses the lower of purchase price or appraised value: $330,000 (appraised) < $350,000 (list). LTV = $264,000 / $330,000 = 80%.

**6. D — $30,000.** For conventional loans, 60% of vested retirement account balance: $50,000 × 60% = $30,000.

**7. C — Require documentation of the source.** Any large deposit that is less than 60 days old must be sourced. 45 days is less than 60, and the source cannot be documented, making this a problem that must be resolved before the loan can be approved.

**8. B — A gift letter.** The gift letter must state the amount, the relationship of the donor, and that no repayment is expected. The mother typically also needs to show 2 months of bank statements to prove the funds were hers.

**9. C — The underwriter.** The underwriter makes all credit decisions — approve, deny, suspend, or approve with conditions. The MLO takes the application; the processor organizes it; the underwriter decides.

**10. B — Possible approval with compensating factors.** Conventional loans with DU/LPA approval can go above 45% DTI with compensating factors. A 46% DTI is not automatically denied on conventional loans — the AUS may approve it based on credit score, reserves, etc.

---
