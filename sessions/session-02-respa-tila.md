# Session 2: RESPA & TILA — The Two Most Tested Laws

**Study Mode:** Deep Dive → Flashcards → Quiz → Scenario Practice
**Time:** ~90 minutes
**Exam Weight:** Domain 1 (Federal Laws) = 24% — RESPA and TILA consistently make up the bulk of these questions

---

## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

---

### Why RESPA & TILA Are the Most Tested Laws

RESPA governs **settlement procedures and kickbacks**. TILA governs **cost disclosure and transparency**. The 2015 TRID rule merged their disclosure forms. Together, they cover:
- How and when to give borrowers loan cost information
- What fees can and can't be charged
- Who can refer business and when
- The mechanics of disclosures, tolerances, and rescission

Every MLO touches these laws on every loan. Expect 10–14 questions from this area alone.

---

## RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) — Regulation X

**Purpose:** Protect borrowers from inflated settlement costs, kickbacks, and abusive referral practices.

**Applies to:** Any "federally related mortgage loan" — virtually all residential mortgages on 1-4 unit dwellings.

---

### RESPA Section 8 — Kickbacks & Referral Fees (MOST TESTED)

**The rule:** No person shall give or accept a fee, kickback, or thing of value in exchange for referrals of settlement service business.

**"Thing of value"** includes: cash, gifts, free services, entertainment, office space, favorable lease terms, marketing materials, vacations, technology platforms — anything of benefit.

**Settlement services** include: title insurance, appraisals, inspections, attorney services, loan origination, escrow, hazard insurance, credit reports, mortgage insurance.

**What's Allowed vs. Prohibited:**

| ✅ Permitted | ❌ Prohibited |
|---|---|
| Paying for services actually and legitimately performed | Paying a referral fee with no services rendered |
| Affiliated Business Arrangement (AfBA) with proper disclosure | Kickbacks from settlement service companies |
| Marketing Service Agreements (MSAs) — IF bona fide services are performed and fee is reasonable | MSAs used as a pretext for paying referral fees |
| A payment of a thing of value for goods and facilities actually furnished | Split fees where no service was provided for the portion paid |

**RESPA §8 Penalty:**
- Up to **1 year in prison** and fines up to **$10,000 per violation**
- Private right of action: borrower can sue for **3× the amount** of the kickback

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** There is no "de minimis" (small amount) exception to RESPA §8. A $25 gift card for a referral is just as illegal as $2,500. The *thing of value* = the violation.

---

### Affiliated Business Arrangements (AfBA)

An AfBA exists when a settlement service provider refers business to a company it has an **ownership interest** in or **an associate relationship** with.

**AfBA is permitted if:**
1. The consumer receives a written **AfBA disclosure** at the time of the referral
2. The consumer is told they are **not required** to use the affiliated company
3. The only compensation to the referring party is a **return on ownership interest** (not per-referral fees)

**When to disclose:** At the **time of the referral** — not at application, not at closing, not later.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Seller requiring buyer to use their title company = RESPA Section 9 violation. AfBA requires disclosure + choice, not coercion.

---

### RESPA Section 9 — Title Insurance
- Sellers **cannot require** buyers to use a specific title insurance company as a condition of sale.
- Violation = 3× the charges paid for the title insurance.

---

### RESPA Section 10 — Escrow Accounts
- Limits the escrow cushion a lender may require
- Maximum cushion: **1/6 of estimated annual escrow disbursements** (approximately 2 months)
- Lender must perform **annual escrow analysis**
- At closing, lender may collect up to 2 months of escrow payments as initial deposit
- **Shortage vs. Deficiency:**
  - **Shortage** = account balance is below required minimum cushion → lender can collect the shortage over **12 months**
  - **Deficiency** = actual negative balance in escrow → lender may demand full repayment within **30 days** OR allow borrower to repay over 12 months

---

### RESPA Disclosures — What, When, and Why

| Disclosure | Replaces | When Required | Delivered Within |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Loan Estimate (LE)** | Good Faith Estimate (GFE) | Upon complete application | 3 business days |
| **Closing Disclosure (CD)** | HUD-1 Settlement Statement | Before closing | 3 business days BEFORE consummation |
| **Servicing Disclosure** | Mortgage Servicing Disclosure | At application | 3 business days |
| **AfBA Disclosure** | AfBA Statement | At time of referral to affiliate | At time of referral |
| **Special Information Booklet** | RESPA Booklet | Purchase loans only | 3 business days of application |

**What Triggers a Complete RESPA Application (The 6 Magic Triggers):**
1. Borrower's **name**
2. Borrower's **income**
3. Borrower's **Social Security number** (to pull credit)
4. **Property address**
5. **Estimated value** of the property
6. **Loan amount desired**

Once ALL 6 are collected → complete application → LE must be issued within 3 business days.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** A lender cannot require the borrower to submit additional documentation BEFORE accepting an application. Collecting the 6 triggers = application whether the lender calls it that or not.

---

## TILA (Truth in Lending Act) — Regulation Z

**Purpose:** Require uniform disclosure of the TRUE cost of credit, enabling consumers to comparison shop.

**Applies to:** Consumer credit transactions, including residential mortgages.

---

### The APR — Annual Percentage Rate

**What it is:** The interest rate PLUS certain fees, expressed as an annual percentage, spread over the loan term.

**Why it matters:** The APR is always equal to or higher than the note rate (because fees are included). On a no-cost loan, APR = note rate. On a loan with origination fees/points, APR > note rate.

**Finance Charges (included in APR calculation):**
- Origination fees / discount points
- Mortgage insurance premiums (MIP/PMI)
- Prepaid interest
- Loan processing fees (if charged by the lender)

**NOT Finance Charges (excluded from APR):**
- Appraisal fees
- Title search and title insurance
- Credit report fees
- Survey fees
- Transfer taxes and recording fees
- Homeowner's insurance premiums

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** If the borrower can shop for a service independently (appraisal, title), it's typically NOT a finance charge. If the lender requires it and controls it (origination fee, MIP), it IS.

**APR Tolerances (LE to CD):**
- **Regular mortgage loans:** APR cannot increase by more than **0.125%** from LE to CD
- **Irregular loans** (ARMs, etc.): Tolerance is **0.25%**
- If the APR increases beyond tolerance: lender must issue a revised LE and restart the **3-business-day** waiting period

---

### TRID — The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule (2015)

TRID merged the GFE/RESPA booklet with the TILA disclosure forms into two streamlined documents.

**The Loan Estimate (LE):**
- 3 pages
- Issued within **3 business days** of complete application
- Shows: estimated rate, APR, monthly payment, loan costs, cash to close
- "Business day" for the LE = any calendar day except Sundays and legal public holidays
- Borrower must **acknowledge receipt** before lender can collect any fees beyond a bona fide credit report fee

**The Closing Disclosure (CD):**
- 5 pages
- Must be received by the borrower **3 business days before consummation** (not just mailed — received)
- "Business day" for the CD waiting period = **all calendar days except Sundays and legal public holidays** (NOTE: Saturday counts as a business day for the CD waiting period)
- Shows actual final loan terms, all costs, cash to close

**CD Business Day Example:**
- CD emailed Monday → counts as received Monday
- Count: Tuesday = Day 1, Wednesday = Day 2, **Saturday = Day 3** (Saturday counts!)
- Earliest closing = **Monday** (next business day after the 3-day period)

---

### TRID Tolerance Buckets

**Three categories control what fees can increase and by how much:**

| Category | Tolerance | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| **Zero tolerance** | 0% — cannot increase at all | Origination fees, points, lender-required services (specific provider), transfer taxes |
| **10% aggregate tolerance** | Total of this category can increase no more than 10% | Required third-party services when borrower uses lender's list, recording fees |
| **No tolerance** | Can change freely | Prepaid items (interest, insurance), services the borrower chose independently, seller-paid items |

**If a tolerance is exceeded:** Lender must issue a **cure** — refund the excess to the borrower within **60 calendar days** of settlement.

---

### TRID Changed Circumstances

A lender may issue a **revised LE** (which can reset fees) only when a valid changed circumstance occurs:

**Three Types of Valid Changed Circumstances:**
1. **Extraordinary events:** Natural disasters, acts of war, other unforeseeable events affecting the property or market
2. **New information about the borrower:** Income or employment materially different from what was originally stated; undisclosed liabilities discovered
3. **Borrower-initiated change:** Borrower changes loan program, property, or loan amount

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** "Rate went up" is NOT a changed circumstance. "Flood zone reclassification after application" IS a changed circumstance. Know the difference.

**Timeline:** Revised LE must be issued within **3 business days** of learning about the changed circumstance; borrower must receive it at least **4 business days** before consummation.

---

### Right of Rescission

**What it is:** The borrower's federally protected right to cancel a loan within a set time period.

**Applies to:**
- Refinances of a **primary residence**
- Home equity loans and HELOCs on a **primary residence**

**Does NOT apply to:**
- Purchase transactions (no rescission right on a home purchase)
- Investment or second home refinances
- Business purpose loans

**Standard rescission period:** **3 business days** after consummation OR delivery of the rescission notice and required TILA disclosures — whichever is later.

**Extended rescission period:** Up to **3 years** if the lender failed to deliver required TILA disclosures.

**Waiving rescission:**
- Borrower CAN waive rescission in a **bona fide personal financial emergency** (documented in writing)
- A desire for fast money does NOT qualify as a bona fide emergency

---

### Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans (HPML)

**Threshold:**
- First lien: APR ≥ **1.5% above APOR** (Average Prime Offer Rate)
- Subordinate lien: APR ≥ **3.5% above APOR**
- "Small loan" (< $30,176): APR ≥ **6.5% above APOR**

**HPML Requirements:**
- Mandatory **escrow account** (for taxes and insurance) for at least **5 years**
- Full appraisal required (no desk/drive-by appraisals)
- Second appraisal required if property was acquired within the previous **180 days** at a lower price (flipping rule)
- No prepayment penalties

---

### High-Cost Mortgages (HOEPA — Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act)

**More extreme than HPML — triggered by higher thresholds:**
- First lien: APR ≥ **6.5% above APOR**
- Subordinate lien: APR ≥ **8.5% above APOR**
- **OR** points and fees ≥ **5% of total loan amount** (or $1,000, whichever is greater — for loans under $20,000)
- **OR** prepayment penalty > 2% or extends more than 36 months

**HOEPA Restrictions (these are PROHIBITED on high-cost loans):**
- Balloon payments (within first 10 years, unless certain conditions met)
- Negative amortization (balance growing over time)
- Prepayment penalties (in most cases)
- Calling the loan due and payable without justification (acceleration)
- Charging fees to modify the loan

**HOEPA Requirements:**
- Mandatory pre-loan **HUD-approved counseling** before origination
- Special HOEPA disclosure at least **3 business days** before consummation
- Lender must verify borrower's ability to repay

---

### LO Compensation Rule (Regulation Z)

**What it prohibits:**
- MLO compensation CANNOT be based on any **loan term** (interest rate, APR, points, LTV, DTI)
- **Dual compensation** is prohibited: MLO cannot receive payment from BOTH the borrower AND the lender on the same transaction

**What IS permissible:**
- Compensation based on **loan amount** (larger loan = higher pay)
- Compensation based on **loan type** (purchase vs. refinance treated differently)
- Compensation based on **geographic area** of origination
- Flat per-loan fee structures

**Anti-Steering:**
Under Dodd-Frank's anti-steering provisions, an MLO must present loan options from which a borrower qualifies, including the option with the lowest rate, the lowest total origination costs, and the lowest total costs for the loan type. MLOs cannot steer borrowers toward loans that benefit the MLO at the borrower's expense.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** "Can the MLO be paid more for loans at a higher interest rate?" → NO. "Can the MLO be paid more for larger loan amounts?" → YES.

## 🎯 PART 4: SCENARIO PRACTICE

*Apply your knowledge to these 5 real-world RESPA/TILA situations.*

---

**Scenario A**
A title company offers to pay for an MLO's company website redesign ($8,000) in exchange for "brand placement" on the site and the expectation that the company will continue referring clients to the title company. The MLO's manager calls it a "marketing partnership." What's the real issue?

**Analysis:** Despite the marketing language, this is a quid pro quo arrangement — the website redesign (a thing of value) is exchanged with the expectation of referrals. RESPA §8 doesn't care what you call it. If there's no bona fide service being provided equal to the $8,000, this is a kickback. The CFPB has aggressively pursued MSA arrangements that lack bona fide service value.

---

**Scenario B**
A borrower receives the Closing Disclosure on Friday via email. They want to close the following Wednesday. Can they?

**Analysis:** CD received Friday. Saturday = Day 1 (Saturday counts for TRID's CD waiting period). Sunday = does not count. Monday = Day 2. Tuesday = Day 3. Wednesday = 4th day — YES, they can close on Wednesday. (If Sunday did not count, the 3-business-day period ends Tuesday, and the earliest closing is Wednesday.)

---

**Scenario C**
After the Loan Estimate is issued, the appraiser discovers the property is in a FEMA-designated flood zone — something neither the lender nor borrower knew at application. Flood insurance will add $1,800/year to the escrow. Can the lender issue a revised LE?

**Analysis:** Yes. The flood zone discovery is an extraordinary event (or new information) that qualifies as a valid changed circumstance under TRID. The lender may issue a revised LE within 3 business days of learning this, resetting the relevant fee tolerances for flood-related costs.

---

**Scenario D**
An MLO is paid a $2,000 flat fee per loan, regardless of loan amount or rate. A colleague suggests the MLO could earn more by pushing borrowers toward 30-year loans rather than 15-year loans. Would doing so violate the LO Comp Rule?

**Analysis:** If the MLO is being paid a flat fee per loan (not based on loan term), pushing borrowers toward 30-year loans for personal gain (not borrower benefit) would implicate the anti-steering provisions of Dodd-Frank — steering borrowers to products not in their best interest. The LO Comp Rule and anti-steering rules work together to protect borrowers.

---

**Scenario E**
A borrower refinances in February. In March, they discover the lender never gave them the TILA rescission notice at closing. They want to rescind now. Can they?

**Analysis:** Yes. When a lender fails to provide required TILA disclosures (including the rescission notice), the borrower's right of rescission is extended to **3 years** from consummation. The borrower has grounds to rescind, and the lender must accept a valid rescission notice within the 3-year window.
