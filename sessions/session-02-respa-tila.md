## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

---

## RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) — Reg X

**Purpose:** Protects borrowers from abusive practices in the settlement process — specifically kickbacks, referral fees, and inflated settlement costs.

### Key RESPA Provisions

**Section 8 — Kickbacks (MOST TESTED)**
- Prohibits paying or receiving fees for referrals of settlement services
- Settlement services = title, appraisal, insurance, closing services, mortgage
- **Exception:** Bona fide services actually performed CAN be compensated
- **Penalty:** Up to 1 year imprisonment + fine up to $10,000

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** A title company giving an MLO a "marketing" fee = RESPA §8 violation. No referral fees. Period.

**Section 9 — Title Insurance**
- Seller CANNOT require buyer to use a specific title insurance company as a condition of sale

**Section 10 — Escrow Accounts**
- Limits how much lenders can require in escrow cushion
- Max cushion: **1/6 of estimated annual disbursements** (2 months)
- Annual escrow analysis required

**RESPA Disclosures:**

| Disclosure | When Required | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| Loan Estimate (LE) | Replaced GFE | Within 3 business days of application |
| Closing Disclosure (CD) | Replaced HUD-1 | 3 business days BEFORE closing |
| Servicing Disclosure | At application | Within 3 business days |
| Affiliated Business Arrangement (AfBA) | When referring to affiliate | At time of referral |

**What triggers a RESPA application?**
- 6 pieces of info = application:
  1. Name
  2. Income
  3. SSN (for credit check)
  4. Property address
  5. Estimated property value
  6. Loan amount desired

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Once all 6 items are collected = application exists. LE must be issued within 3 business days.

## TILA (Truth in Lending Act) — Reg Z

**Purpose:** Requires lenders to disclose the TRUE cost of credit so borrowers can comparison shop.

### Key TILA Requirements

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**
- Must be disclosed
- Includes interest rate + fees expressed as annual rate
- More accurate reflection of loan cost than the note rate

**APR Tolerance (if APR changes between LE and CD):**
- Regular loans: APR cannot change by more than **0.125%**
- Irregular loans: APR cannot change by more than **0.25%**
- If it does → new LE must be issued, new 3-day waiting period

**Right of Rescission**
- Applies to: Refinances and home equity loans on PRIMARY residence
- Does NOT apply to: Purchase transactions
- Borrower has **3 business days** after consummation to rescind
- Extended rescission: Up to **3 years** if proper disclosures not provided

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** No right of rescission on a purchase! Only refinances/HELOCs on primary residence.

**TRID (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule)**
Merged RESPA and TILA disclosures into two forms:
- **Loan Estimate (LE)** — 3 pages, given within 3 business days of application
- **Closing Disclosure (CD)** — 5 pages, given 3 business days before closing

**Loan Estimate Tolerances:**

| Fee Category | Tolerance |
|---|---|
| Origination charges | 0% — cannot increase at all |
| Required services (no shopping) | 0% |
| Required services (can shop, used lender list) | 10% aggregate |
| Prepaid interest, insurance premiums | No tolerance limit |
| Services NOT required by lender | No tolerance limit |

**Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans (HPML)**
- Rate is ≥ 1.5% above APOR for first lien
- Rate is ≥ 3.5% above APOR for subordinate lien
- **Requirements:** Mandatory escrow (5 years), appraisal required, no prepayment penalty

**High-Cost Mortgage (HOEPA)**
- Rate is ≥ 6.5% above APOR (first lien)
- Points and fees ≥ 5% of loan amount
- **Restrictions:** No balloon payments (in most cases), no negative amortization, mandatory counseling

**LO Compensation Rule (Reg Z)**
- MLO compensation CANNOT be based on loan terms (rate, points, APR)
- MLO CAN be compensated based on loan amount
- Dual compensation prohibited: cannot receive pay from both borrower and lender on same loan
