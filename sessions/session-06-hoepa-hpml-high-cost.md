## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

HOEPA and HPML are two of the most tested and most confused topics on the SAFE exam. Many candidates mix up the thresholds and requirements. By the end of this session, you'll be able to distinguish them instantly. Expect 6-10 questions.

---

### The APOR — Average Prime Offer Rate

Before diving into HOEPA and HPML, you must understand **APOR**.

**What Is APOR?**
The Average Prime Offer Rate is the benchmark interest rate used to determine whether a loan is "high-cost" or "higher-priced."

- Published **weekly** by the CFPB (originally published by the Federal Reserve)
- Based on survey data from the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey
- Represents the average rate offered to well-qualified borrowers for comparable transactions
- A separate APOR exists for each loan type (fixed-rate 30-year, ARM 5/1, etc.)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** APOR is published **weekly** by the CFPB. It's the baseline — both HOEPA and HPML are defined by how far a loan's APR exceeds APOR.

---

### 1. HOEPA — Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act

**Background:**
HOEPA was originally enacted in 1994 as an amendment to TILA (Truth in Lending Act) and was significantly expanded by Dodd-Frank in 2010. It targets the most predatory loans and is implemented under **Regulation Z**.

**HOEPA applies to:**
- Closed-end home purchase loans
- Refinance transactions
- Home equity loans
- Does NOT apply to: HELOCs, reverse mortgages (HECMs), construction loans

---

**HOEPA Triggers — When Does a Loan Become "High-Cost"?**

A loan becomes a **High-Cost Mortgage** under HOEPA if it meets ANY of these three triggers:

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---|---|
| **Rate trigger (1st lien)** | APR > APOR + **6.5%** |
| **Rate trigger (subordinate lien)** | APR > APOR + **8.5%** |
| **Fee trigger** | Points & fees > **5% of loan** OR **$1,000** (whichever is less, on loans under $20,000) |
| **Prepayment penalty trigger** | Prepayment penalty > 2% of amount prepaid, OR prepayment penalty can be charged more than 36 months after loan |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — Critical Numbers:**
> - HOEPA 1st lien: **APR > APOR + 6.5%**
> - HOEPA subordinate lien: **APR > APOR + 8.5%**
> - Fee trigger: **5%** of loan amount

---

**HOEPA Restrictions — What High-Cost Loans CANNOT Have:**

| Restriction | Rule |
|---|---|
| **No balloon payments** | (except small creditors, qualified mortgages, bridge loans) |
| **No negative amortization** | Balance cannot grow |
| **No prepayment penalties** | Prohibited entirely after Dodd-Frank expansion |
| **No acceleration clauses** | Cannot call the loan due without cause |
| **No loan flipping** | Cannot refinance a HOEPA loan within 1 year without benefit to borrower |
| **No advance payments** | Cannot require more than 2 advance periodic payments at closing |
| **No lender-financed credit insurance** | Cannot wrap insurance premiums into the loan |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** After Dodd-Frank, **prepayment penalties are completely prohibited** on HOEPA (high-cost) loans. This is tested.

---

**HOEPA Required Disclosures:**

1. Must provide enhanced HOEPA disclosures **at least 3 business days before consummation** (closing)
2. Disclosure must state specific terms: APR, monthly payment, amount borrowed
3. Must include notice that borrower does NOT have to complete the loan
4. Borrower must receive **housing counseling** from a HUD-approved counselor BEFORE closing

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** HOEPA requires **mandatory housing counseling** before closing — this is unique to high-cost loans.

---

**HOEPA Enhanced Disclosures Include:**

- "You are not required to complete this agreement"
- "If you sign, you could lose your home and your money invested in it"
- "Interest rates and monthly payments can increase"
- The specific APR and monthly payment amounts

---

### 2. HPML — Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans

**Background:**
HPML was created by the Federal Reserve Board in 2008 (now administered by the CFPB) under **Regulation Z**. It catches loans that are higher-priced than prime but don't meet HOEPA's higher thresholds.

---

**HPML Triggers — When Is a Loan "Higher-Priced"?**

| Trigger | Threshold |
|---|---|
| **Rate trigger (1st lien)** | APR > APOR + **1.5%** |
| **Rate trigger (subordinate lien)** | APR > APOR + **3.5%** |
| **Rate trigger (jumbo)** | APR > APOR + **2.5%** (for jumbo loans) |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — Critical Comparison:**
> - HPML 1st lien: **APR > APOR + 1.5%** (lower threshold, more loans caught)
> - HOEPA 1st lien: **APR > APOR + 6.5%** (much higher threshold, fewer loans)
> HPML has the LOWER threshold. More loans qualify as HPML than as HOEPA.

---

**HPML Requirements — What Higher-Priced Loans Must Have:**

| Requirement | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Mandatory escrow** | Must establish escrow for taxes and insurance for **at least 5 years** |
| **Appraisal required** | Must obtain a written appraisal (AMC model) |
| **Second appraisal** | May be required for certain flipped properties |
| **No prepayment penalties** | Generally prohibited; narrow exceptions allowed |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **HPML requires a 5-year escrow account** — this is one of the most tested facts. The escrow for taxes and insurance must be maintained for a minimum of 5 years.

---

**HPML Appraisal Rules:**

For HPML loans, in addition to the standard appraisal:
- An additional **free copy of the appraisal** must be given to the borrower at least 3 business days before consummation
- For properties that were sold within 180 days at a lower price (potential flipping), a **second independent appraisal** may be required at NO COST to the borrower

---

**Exemptions from HPML:**

- Qualified Mortgages (standard QM — but see rebuttable presumption)
- HELOCs
- Reverse mortgages (HECMs)
- Construction loans (12 months or less)

---

### 3. Side-by-Side Comparison: HOEPA vs. HPML

This is the most important table in this session. Memorize it.

| Feature | HOEPA (High-Cost) | HPML (Higher-Priced) |
|---|---|---|
| **Also called** | High-Cost Mortgage | Higher-Priced Mortgage Loan |
| **1st lien rate trigger** | APR > APOR + **6.5%** | APR > APOR + **1.5%** |
| **Subordinate lien trigger** | APR > APOR + **8.5%** | APR > APOR + **3.5%** |
| **Fee trigger** | >5% of loan amount | None |
| **Escrow required** | No specific escrow rule | **5 years mandatory** |
| **Mandatory counseling** | **Yes — required** | No |
| **Appraisal required** | No specific rule | **Yes** |
| **Prepayment penalty** | **Prohibited entirely** | Generally prohibited |
| **Negative amortization** | **Prohibited** | No specific rule |
| **Balloon payment** | **Generally prohibited** | No specific rule |
| **Special disclosures** | Yes — 3 business days before closing | No (standard LE/CD apply) |
| **Threshold level** | HIGHER threshold (fewer loans) | LOWER threshold (more loans) |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — The Key Distinction:** HOEPA has **higher** rate thresholds and **more** restrictions. HPML has **lower** thresholds and **fewer** (but still important) restrictions. If a loan is HOEPA, it is almost certainly also HPML (HOEPA is a subset of higher-priced loans).

---

### 4. Escrow Requirements in Detail

**Standard QM Loans:**
- No federal requirement to escrow — lender's choice
- If lender doesn't escrow, borrower pays taxes and insurance directly

**HPML Loans:**
- **Mandatory 5-year escrow** for property taxes and homeowner's insurance
- After 5 years, borrower may cancel escrow under certain conditions

**How to Remember:**
- Standard loan = "You're responsible for your own taxes and insurance (maybe)"
- HPML = "We're holding your tax/insurance money for at least 5 years"
- HOEPA = Even worse terms mean even more scrutiny, but the escrow rule comes from HPML threshold

---

### 5. How HOEPA and HPML Interact with QM

| Loan Type | QM Status | HPML Status | HOEPA Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prime 30-year fixed | Usually yes | No | No |
| Slightly above-prime rate | May be QM | Possibly (if >APOR+1.5%) | No |
| Well above prime | Non-QM | Yes (HPML) | Possibly if >6.5% above |
| Predatory/extreme rate | Non-QM | Yes | Yes (HOEPA) |

---

### 6. Practical Examples

**Example 1:**
Current APOR for 30-year fixed = 6.00%
Loan APR = 7.75%
Rate spread = 1.75% above APOR
- HPML? Yes (1.75% > 1.5% threshold for 1st lien)
- HOEPA? No (1.75% < 6.5% threshold)
- Requirements: 5-year escrow, appraisal required

**Example 2:**
Current APOR for 30-year fixed = 6.00%
Loan APR = 13.25%
Rate spread = 7.25% above APOR
- HPML? Yes (7.25% > 1.5%)
- HOEPA? Yes (7.25% > 6.5%)
- Requirements: ALL HOEPA restrictions + counseling + enhanced disclosures + 5-year escrow

**Example 3:**
Current APOR = 6.00%
Loan APR = 6.90%
Loan fees = 4.5% of loan amount
- HPML? No (0.90% < 1.5% threshold)
- HOEPA? No (rate is fine; fees are 4.5% < 5% threshold)
- Standard loan, no special requirements

### Answer Key

**1. B — HPML only.** APR of 8.25% vs. APOR of 6.50% = spread of 1.75%. This exceeds the HPML 1st lien threshold of 1.5%, making it HPML. However, 1.75% is well below the HOEPA 1st lien threshold of 6.5%, so it is NOT HOEPA.

**2. B — HUD-approved housing counseling.** HOEPA requires mandatory counseling from a HUD-approved housing counselor before the borrower signs the loan documents.

**3. C — 5 years.** HPML requires a mandatory escrow account for property taxes and homeowner's insurance for at least 5 years.

**4. B — Weekly.** The CFPB publishes APOR on a weekly basis.

**5. C — Balloon payment.** Balloon payments are generally prohibited on HOEPA high-cost mortgages. Adjustable rates, points, and fixed rates are all permissible features.

**6. C — Both HPML and HOEPA.** A 7.5% spread above APOR exceeds both the HPML threshold (1.5%) and the HOEPA threshold (6.5%) for first liens, making it both HPML and HOEPA simultaneously.

**7. D — APR > APOR + 8.5%.** For subordinate liens, HOEPA's rate trigger is 8.5% above APOR (vs. 6.5% for first liens). For reference, HPML's subordinate lien trigger is 3.5%.

**8. C — A written appraisal.** HPML requires a written appraisal performed by a certified or licensed appraiser. The other items listed are HOEPA requirements (counseling, enhanced disclosures) not HPML-specific requirements.

**9. C — 30-year ARM at 14% when APOR is 7%.** This loan has a 7% spread above APOR, which exceeds the HOEPA 1st lien threshold of 6.5%. Note: HELOCs are exempt from HOEPA.

**10. B — At least 3 business days before closing.** HOEPA requires enhanced disclosures to be provided at least 3 business days before consummation, giving borrowers time to review and potentially walk away.
