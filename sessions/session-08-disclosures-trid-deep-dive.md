## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

TRID (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure) rules govern every consumer mortgage transaction. The exam tests specific timelines, tolerance categories, and business day definitions repeatedly. Expect 12-18 questions on this material — it's one of the highest-yield topics on the exam.

---

### 1. What Is TRID?

**TRID = TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure**

Before TRID (effective October 3, 2015):
- Borrowers received a **Good Faith Estimate (GFE)** and a **Truth-in-Lending disclosure** at application
- Borrowers received a **HUD-1 Settlement Statement** at closing

After TRID:
- GFE + TIL disclosure → replaced by **Loan Estimate (LE)**
- HUD-1 → replaced by **Closing Disclosure (CD)**

**Why TRID was created:**
- Simplify disclosures
- Make it easier for borrowers to compare loan offers
- Give borrowers time to review before closing
- Ensure consistency between what was promised and what was delivered

**What TRID Covers:**
- Most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property
- Includes: Purchase loans, refinances, construction-to-perm
- Does NOT cover: HELOCs, reverse mortgages, mobile homes not attached to land, commercial loans

### 2. The Complete TRID Timeline

Master this timeline — it's tested constantly:

```
STEP 1: Application received (all 6 triggers met)
         ↓
         3 BUSINESS DAYS
         ↓
STEP 2: Loan Estimate (LE) delivered
         ↓
         WAIT: Borrower has 10 business days to indicate intent to proceed
         (7-business-day waiting period begins from LE delivery)
         ↓
STEP 3: 7-BUSINESS-DAY WAITING PERIOD
         (Cannot close until at least 7 business days after LE delivery)
         ↓
STEP 4: Changed circumstances may trigger REVISED LE
         If revised LE issued: New 3-business-day waiting period before closing
         ↓
STEP 5: Closing Disclosure (CD) delivered
         ↓
         3 BUSINESS DAYS
         ↓
STEP 6: Closing / Consummation
```

**Critical TRID Timelines:**

| Event | Deadline |
|---|---|
| Loan Estimate delivery | Within **3 business days** of complete application |
| Loan Estimate expiration | 10 business days after delivery |
| Waiting period after LE | **7 business days** must pass before closing |
| Closing Disclosure delivery | At least **3 business days** before closing |
| Revised CD waiting period | Certain changes = new 3-business-day waiting period |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — The Key Numbers:** 3-7-3. **3** days to send LE, **7** days minimum before closing, **3** days before closing to send CD.

---

### 3. Business Day Definitions Under TRID

This is one of the trickiest parts — there are TWO different definitions of "business day" used in TRID:

**Definition 1 — "General Business Day":**
Used for: The 3-business-day rule for sending the LE after application

= Any day the creditor's offices are open to the public for carrying out substantially all business functions

In practice: Usually Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays (if the lender is open on Saturday, Saturday counts)

---

**Definition 2 — "Specific Business Day":**
Used for: The 7-business-day waiting period AND the 3-business-day CD delivery before closing

= All calendar days EXCEPT Sundays and federal public holidays

This means: **Saturdays count** as business days for these waiting periods!

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — Most Tested Distinction:** For the 7-day waiting period after the LE, and the 3-day CD review period before closing, **Saturdays DO count** as business days. Sundays and federal holidays do NOT.

**Federal Holidays (don't count for either definition):**
New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas

---

**Practical Example:**
LE delivered on Wednesday.
- 7 business days (Specific): Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday (count) → skip Sunday → Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday → Earliest closing = **Thursday** (8th day, or consumer can close on Wednesday if that's day 7)

> Wait — let's be precise: If LE delivered Wednesday, the 7-day count begins the NEXT business day.
> Day 1 = Thursday, Day 2 = Friday, Day 3 = Saturday, Day 4 = Monday, Day 5 = Tuesday, Day 6 = Wednesday, Day 7 = Thursday (next). Earliest closing = **following Thursday**.

---

### 4. The Loan Estimate (LE) — Page by Page

The LE is a 3-page document that must be given to the consumer within 3 business days of application.

**Page 1 — Loan Terms and Projected Payments:**
- Loan terms: amount, interest rate, monthly P&I payment
- Can the interest rate increase? (Yes/No — important for ARMs)
- Does the loan have a prepayment penalty? Balloon payment?
- Projected payments table: Shows payment breakdown over time (P&I, MIP/PMI, taxes, insurance)
- Estimated closing costs (total)
- Cash to close estimate

**Page 2 — Closing Cost Details:**
- Section A: Origination charges (zero tolerance)
- Section B: Services borrower cannot shop for (zero tolerance)
- Section C: Services borrower CAN shop for (10% tolerance)
- Section E: Taxes and government fees
- Section F: Prepaids (insurance, interest, taxes)
- Section G: Initial escrow payment at closing
- Section H: Other costs
- Section I: Total closing costs

**Page 3 — Comparisons and Contact Information:**
- APR (Annual Percentage Rate)
- Total interest percentage (TIP) — total interest you'll pay over life of loan as % of loan
- In 5 years: Principal paid + total payments
- Lender/broker contact information
- Loan terms summary

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Page 3 shows the **APR** and **TIP (Total Interest Percentage)**. These are the comparison tools. The APR is always higher than the interest rate because it includes fees.

---

### 5. The Closing Disclosure (CD) — What's Inside

The CD is a 5-page document that must be given to the consumer at least 3 business days before closing.

**Page 1:** Loan terms, projected payments, closing costs summary (mirrors LE for comparison)
**Page 2:** Closing cost details (exactly mirrors LE Page 2 for comparison)
**Page 3:** Alternative cash to close table, summaries of transactions (purchase contract settlement)
**Page 4:** Additional information — loan disclosures (escrow account, demand feature, etc.)
**Page 5:** Loan calculations (total payments, finance charge, APR, TIP), contact information, signature

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The CD has **5 pages**; the LE has **3 pages**. The CD mirrors the LE so borrowers can compare what was promised to what's actually being charged.

---

**When Can a CD Be Issued Early?**
The lender may issue the CD earlier than 3 days before closing, as long as the 3-business-day minimum is met. Some lenders issue it 7-10 days early as a best practice.

**Events That Require a New 3-Day CD Waiting Period:**
- APR increases by more than 0.125%
- Loan product changes (e.g., fixed to ARM)
- Prepayment penalty is added

Events that do NOT require a new 3-day waiting period:
- APR decreases
- Seller concessions change
- Minor corrections

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Not all CD changes restart the clock. Only APR increase > 0.125%, product change, or prepayment penalty addition restart the 3-day waiting period.

---

### 6. Changed Circumstances — When Can You Issue a Revised LE?

A lender can issue a **revised LE** (and reset fee baselines) only when there is a valid "changed circumstance":

**Valid Changed Circumstances:**
1. **Natural disaster or emergency** affecting the property or the lender
2. **New information about the borrower or transaction** not previously known (e.g., appraisal reveals property issues, borrower reveals additional debt)
3. **Borrower-requested changes** (different loan amount, product, property)
4. **Interest rate lock** — if rate wasn't locked at LE, once locked, lender may issue revised LE
5. **Expiration of a quoted rate** — if borrower doesn't lock within 10 days of LE

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** A lender CANNOT issue a revised LE simply because they made an error in their initial estimate (if the error was within their control). Changed circumstances must be genuine.

**What Cannot Trigger a Revised LE:**
- Lender error in estimating fees
- Lender's own internal changes not related to borrower/property
- Market fluctuations in controllable costs

---

### 7. Fee Tolerance Categories

This is one of the most tested topics. Fees fall into three tolerance buckets:

**Category 1 — ZERO TOLERANCE (Cannot increase at all):**
- Lender-imposed origination charges (points, origination fees)
- Transfer taxes
- Services where borrower is NOT allowed to shop (lender-required, lender-selected):
  - Appraisal fee (if lender selects)
  - Credit report fee
  - Flood determination fee
  - Upfront MIP or VA funding fee

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Zero tolerance means exactly that — if the fee was $500 on the LE, it MUST be $500 or less at closing. Any increase (even $1) is a tolerance violation.

**Category 2 — 10% TOLERANCE (Can increase up to 10% total):**
- Recording fees (government fees)
- Services where borrower CAN shop but chose a lender-provided vendor from the Written List of Service Providers

**Category 3 — UNLIMITED TOLERANCE (No cap on increases):**
- Prepaid interest (depends on closing date)
- Homeowner's insurance (borrower chooses policy)
- Initial escrow payments (property taxes — amounts fluctuate)
- Services borrower shopped for themselves (chose their own vendor NOT on lender list)
- Owner's title insurance (if borrower opts in)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip — Tolerance Categories Summary:**
> - ZERO: Lender's own fees, required third-party services where lender picks vendor
> - 10%: Recording fees + services where borrower used lender's list
> - UNLIMITED: Prepaids, escrow, borrower-selected services

---

**What Happens When Tolerance Is Exceeded?**
The lender must provide a **cure** — refund the difference to the borrower within 60 calendar days of consummation. This must come from the lender, not the settlement agent.

---

### 8. Affiliated Business Arrangements (AfBA)

**What Is an AfBA?**
When a settlement service provider refers business to an affiliated company in which the referrer has a financial interest.

**Examples:**
- Real estate company refers to its affiliated title company
- Mortgage company refers to its affiliated homeowner's insurance company

**RESPA Requirements for AfBA:**
1. The referring party must give the borrower an **AfBA Disclosure** at the time of referral
2. The disclosure must state the referring party's ownership interest
3. The disclosure must tell the borrower they are NOT required to use the affiliate

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** AfBA disclosure must be given at the **time of referral** — not at closing, not at application, but AT THE MOMENT OF REFERRAL.

---

### 9. Servicing Disclosure

Under RESPA, lenders must provide a **Servicing Disclosure Statement** within **3 business days** of application.

This disclosure tells the borrower:
- Whether the lender intends to transfer servicing of the loan
- The percentage of loans the lender transferred in the past
- The borrower's rights when servicing is transferred

**When Servicing Is Actually Transferred:**
- 15 days before transfer: Notice from current servicer
- 15 days after transfer: Notice from new servicer
- 60-day grace period: During which borrower cannot be penalized for sending payment to old servicer

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Servicing disclosure = within **3 business days** of application. Actual transfer notice = **15 days** before.

---

### 10. Right of Rescission

The right of rescission is the borrower's right to cancel a transaction within a specific period.

**When It Applies:**
- Refinances on a **primary residence**
- Home equity loans and HELOCs on a primary residence

**When It Does NOT Apply:**
- Purchase transactions (buying a home — no rescission)
- Loans on investment properties or second homes
- Business-purpose loans

**Timeframe:**
- Borrower has **3 business days** to rescind (cancel) after consummation
- Runs through midnight of the 3rd business day
- If rescission notices weren't properly provided → right extends to **3 years**

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The right of rescission does NOT apply to purchase transactions. It only applies to refinances and HE loans on a primary residence. This is a classic exam trap.

**Rescission Business Day Definition:**
Same as TRID CD rule — all days except Sundays and federal holidays. So Saturday counts.

### Answer Key

**1. C — Thursday.** Application received Monday. 3 business days (using general business day definition, Mon-Sat): Day 1 = Tuesday, Day 2 = Wednesday, Day 3 = Thursday. LE due Thursday.

**2. C — The following Thursday.** LE delivered Tuesday. 7-business-day waiting period (specific definition: all days except Sundays and federal holidays): Day 1=Wed, Day 2=Thu, Day 3=Fri, Day 4=Sat, skip Sun, Day 5=Mon, Day 6=Tue, Day 7=Wed. Can close Thursday (the day after the 7th day). Earliest close = **Thursday**.

**3. B — Zero tolerance violation.** Credit report fees are in the zero tolerance category (required service where the lender selects the provider). Any increase above the LE amount is a violation.

**4. B — APR increases from 6.875% to 7.025%.** The increase is 0.15%, which exceeds the 0.125% threshold, triggering a new 3-day waiting period. Seller concessions and minor decreases do not restart the clock.

**5. C — Saturday night at midnight.** Right of rescission = 3 business days after closing using the specific business day definition (all days except Sundays and federal holidays). Closing Wednesday: Day 1=Thursday, Day 2=Friday, Day 3=Saturday. Expires Saturday midnight.

**6. B — AfBA disclosure at the time of referral.** RESPA requires an AfBA disclosure to be given at the moment of referral — not later.

**7. C — APR and Total Interest Percentage (TIP).** Page 3 contains the comparison tools — APR (cost of credit on an annual basis) and TIP (total interest as a percentage of loan over the life of the loan).

**8. B — Yes — a rate lock is a valid changed circumstance.** If the rate was not locked at the time of the initial LE and the borrower subsequently locks the rate, the lender may issue a revised LE reflecting the locked rate.

**9. C — Days the lender's offices are open for business.** The 3-business-day rule for delivering the LE uses the "general business day" definition — any day the creditor's offices are open for business (including some Saturdays if the lender operates them). This is different from the "specific business day" definition used for the 7-day waiting period.

**10. C — Refund within 60 calendar days.** When a tolerance is violated (charged more than allowed), the lender must cure the violation by refunding the excess amount to the borrower within 60 calendar days of consummation.
