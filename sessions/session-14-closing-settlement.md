## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

The closing session ties together everything — disclosures, proration, prepaid items, recording, and RESPA's anti-kickback rules. Expect 8-12 questions combining closing mechanics with regulation.

---

### 1. The Closing Process Overview

**What Happens at Closing (Consummation):**

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| **Final walkthrough** | Buyer inspects property one last time before closing |
| **CD review** | Final Closing Disclosure reviewed for accuracy |
| **Signing** | All documents signed (mortgage, note, deed, etc.) |
| **Funding** | Lender wires loan funds to settlement |
| **Recording** | Deed and mortgage recorded with county |
| **Disbursement** | Funds distributed to seller, real estate agents, title company, etc. |

**Who Conducts the Closing:**
- **Attorney states:** Attorney is required (varies by state)
- **Title company states:** Title company handles closing
- **Escrow states:** Escrow company/officer handles closing
- **Dual-role:** Sometimes the same entity performs all functions

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Practice of law varies by state. Some states require an attorney to be present at closing; others allow title companies or escrow companies. The SAFE exam may test which professional types are authorized to conduct closings.

---

### 2. Closing Disclosure (CD) Review

**Purpose of the CD at Closing:**
The CD delivered 3 business days before closing is the "working version." At closing, the final CD must reflect all actual costs and must be signed.

**Comparing LE to Final CD:**
The CD is designed to mirror the LE so borrowers can compare:
- Were fees as estimated?
- Did any zero-tolerance fees increase?
- Are rate and terms as agreed?

**Settlement Agent's Role:**
- Prepares the final CD
- Coordinates receipt of funds from lender and buyer
- Disburses funds to all parties
- Ensures all documents are signed
- Coordinates recording

---

### 3. Prorations at Closing

**What Is Proration?**
Proration divides certain ongoing costs and credits between buyer and seller based on who "owns" the property for what period during a given billing cycle.

**Property Taxes:**
- Property taxes are paid in arrears (after the period they cover) in most states
- If taxes for the year aren't yet paid at closing: Seller owes for the days they owned the property; this is credited to the buyer
- Example: Closing on July 1. Annual taxes = $6,000. Seller owned Jan 1-June 30 (181 days out of 365). Seller credit = $6,000 × (181/365) = $2,975. This appears on the CD as a credit to buyer / debit to seller.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Property taxes in most states are paid IN ARREARS. At closing, the seller will typically credit the buyer for taxes not yet paid for the period they owned the property.

**HOA Dues:**
- Paid in advance in most HOAs (paying for the upcoming period)
- If seller pre-paid HOA dues that extend past closing: Buyer owes seller for the remaining days
- Example: HOA paid through month-end. Closing is mid-month. Buyer reimburses seller for the days they'll benefit.

**Prepaid Interest:**
- Interest on the new mortgage starts on the day of closing
- First mortgage payment is due the 1st of the second month after closing
- Example: Close on the 15th. Interest runs from the 15th through the end of the month (15-16 days depending on month). This is collected at closing.
- Closing earlier in the month = more prepaid interest collected at closing

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Closing later in the month = LESS prepaid interest at closing (fewer days remaining). Closing earlier = MORE prepaid interest. This is sometimes tested as a strategy to reduce cash-to-close.

---

### 4. Prepaid Items at Closing

Prepaid items are costs collected at closing that aren't fees — they're expenses the borrower will owe in the future.

| Prepaid Item | What's Collected | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Homeowner's Insurance** | First year premium upfront + 2 months escrow | Must be paid before closing; typically verified by certificate |
| **Property Taxes** | 2-3 months escrow deposit | Varies by state/timing |
| **Prepaid Interest** | Days from closing to end of month | Based on loan amount × daily rate × days remaining |
| **MIP/PMI** | Sometimes prepaid upfront + monthly | FHA UFMIP often financed |

**Initial Escrow Payment:**
At closing, lenders collect an initial escrow deposit to fund the escrow account for future tax and insurance payments.

**Escrow Cushion:**
Lenders can collect up to 2 months of escrow as a cushion under RESPA. This provides a buffer for timing differences.

---

### 5. Cash to Close Calculation

**The Formula:**

```
Cash to Close = Down Payment + Total Closing Costs 
                - Seller Concessions 
                - Lender Credits 
                - Earnest Money Already Paid 
                - Other Credits (seller-paid items, etc.)
```

**Example:**
- Purchase price: $350,000
- Down payment (5%): $17,500
- Total closing costs (estimated): $8,500
- Seller concession: ($3,000)
- Earnest money: ($2,000)
- Cash to Close = $17,500 + $8,500 - $3,000 - $2,000 = **$21,000**

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Cash to close is NOT just the down payment. It includes ALL costs — down payment, closing costs, prepaids, escrow setup — minus credits.

**Seller Concessions:**
- Seller pays a portion of buyer's closing costs
- Limits by loan type:
  - Conventional: 3% (LTV > 90%), 6% (LTV 75-90%), 9% (LTV < 75%)
  - FHA: 6% of sales price
  - VA: 4% of sales price (for "concessions") + all closing costs
  - USDA: No stated limit (but reasonable)

---

### 6. RESPA Section 8 — Anti-Kickback at Closing

**RESPA Section 8 Review:**
At closing, RESPA §8 prohibits:
- Kickbacks for referring settlement service business
- Splitting fees between persons who didn't perform services
- Fee-splitting with any person for referral of business

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** RESPA §8 violations can result in criminal penalties up to $10,000 fine and/or 1 year imprisonment per violation. Even referring a buyer to a title company in exchange for a gift card = RESPA violation.

**What IS Permitted:**
- Affiliated Business Arrangements (AfBA) with proper disclosure
- Payment for actual services performed
- Referrals between employees of the same company (usually)

---

### 7. Documents Signed at Closing

**The Promissory Note:**
- The borrower's personal promise to repay the loan
- States loan amount, interest rate, payment terms, what happens if default
- This is the IOU — the debt instrument

**The Mortgage/Deed of Trust:**
- The security instrument — gives the lender a lien on the property
- Recorded with the county — makes the lien public record
- States terms for default and foreclosure
- **Mortgage:** Two parties (borrower + lender); used in some states
- **Deed of Trust:** Three parties (borrower = trustor, trustee holds title, lender = beneficiary); used in other states; typically allows non-judicial foreclosure (faster)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Some states use **Mortgages** (two-party), others use **Deeds of Trust** (three-party). Deeds of Trust typically allow faster non-judicial foreclosure.

**Other Documents Signed:**
- Closing Disclosure (final)
- Truth-in-Lending disclosure (if applicable)
- Notice of Right to Cancel (for refinances on primary residence)
- Initial Escrow Account Disclosure
- Flood insurance acknowledgment
- Survey (if applicable)

---

### 8. Recording

**What Is Recording?**
Recording is the act of filing the deed and mortgage/deed of trust with the county recorder's office (Register of Deeds). Recording establishes the public record of ownership and liens.

**Priority:**
- First to record generally has priority (the "first in time, first in right" rule)
- This is why title insurance is important — to find out what's been recorded before you
- A purchase money mortgage (the loan used to buy the property) takes priority over pre-existing liens in many states

**Documents Recorded:**
- Deed (transfers title to buyer)
- Mortgage or Deed of Trust (lender's lien)
- Release of lien (when paid off, the lien is released)

---

### 9. Right of Rescission at Closing

**When Does It Apply?**
Refinances and home equity loans on the borrower's principal residence only.

**NOT on:**
- Purchase transactions (no right of rescission)
- Investment properties
- Second homes

**Documents Required at Closing (for refinances):**
Borrower must receive TWO copies of the Notice of Right to Rescind per borrower.

**Timeframe:**
3 business days (specific definition — all days except Sundays and federal holidays)

**If Borrower Rescinds:**
- Lender must return all money paid by the borrower within 20 calendar days
- Lender's security interest is voided
- Borrower must return any money received from lender within 20 days

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** On a refi, the loan doesn't fund until AFTER the rescission period expires. This is why refinances take 4-5 days after signing to fund — 3 business days for rescission + funding.

**Emergency Waiver:**
Borrower can waive the rescission period if there is a bona fide personal financial emergency (e.g., foreclosure imminent). Must be in writing and specific. Lenders rarely accept this.

---

### 10. After Closing — Servicing and Beyond

**Welcome Letter:**
After closing, borrower receives a "welcome letter" from their servicer with payment instructions.

**Servicing Transfer Timing:**
If the loan is sold, the borrower receives:
- Notice from original servicer at least 15 days before transfer
- Notice from new servicer within 15 days after transfer

**Mortgage Statement:**
RESPA requires servicers to provide annual statements showing:
- Total amount paid
- Amount applied to principal and interest
- Escrow activity
- Remaining balance

**Escrow Account Analysis:**
Servicers must conduct an annual escrow analysis to ensure:
- Enough is being collected for upcoming taxes and insurance
- Refund any excess (surplus > $50)
- Allow for shortage repayment plan (typically 12 months)

### Answer Key

**1. B — approximately $1,820.** January 1 to September 15 = approximately 257 days (through 31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+15 = 258 days, approximately). More simply: $4,800 ÷ 365 × 138 days (roughly Jan-Sep 15) ≈ $1,814. The closest answer is B ($1,820). Property taxes paid in arrears = seller owes for days owned.

**2. C — Friday.** Right of rescission: 3 business days (specific definition — all except Sundays and federal holidays). Tuesday close: Day 1 = Wednesday, Day 2 = Thursday, Day 3 = Friday. Rescission period expires Friday midnight. Loan can fund Saturday or the following business day; however, most lenders fund on the first business day after expiration, which would be Saturday or Monday. But the rescission period EXPIRES on Friday, so technically funding can begin Friday night/Saturday. Exam answer: earliest possible is **Friday** (after 3 business days have passed).

**3. B — RESPA Section 8 violation.** Receiving anything of value (including gift cards) in exchange for referrals of settlement service business is a RESPA §8 kickback violation. No dollar minimum — even a $1 gift is prohibited.

**4. A — $15,500.** The correct cash to close should have been $18,000 - $2,500 = $15,500. The buyer overpaid by $2,500 that should have been credited. The correct amount is $15,500.

**5. C — Mortgage or deed of trust.** The promissory note is the debt instrument (promise to repay). The mortgage/deed of trust is the security instrument that gives the lender a lien on the property as collateral.

**6. C — August 1.** The first mortgage payment is due the 1st of the second month after closing. Closing June 10 → first payment August 1. (The June interest from the 10th to month-end is collected as prepaid interest at closing; July's full month of interest is included in the August 1 payment.)

**7. B — Refund the $85.** Under RESPA, if the escrow analysis reveals a surplus of more than $50, the lender must refund the excess to the borrower. The cushion limit is 2 months, and surpluses over $50 must be returned.

**8. C — The trustee.** In a deed of trust structure, the trustee (a third party) holds legal title on behalf of the lender. The borrower (trustor) has equitable title. The lender (beneficiary) holds the note. This three-party structure allows non-judicial foreclosure in most deed-of-trust states.

**9. D — $12,000 (6% of purchase price).** FHA allows seller concessions of up to 6% of the sales price. 6% × $200,000 = $12,000.

**10. B — From the closing date to the end of the closing month.** Prepaid interest covers the days from closing to month-end because the first payment (due 2 months later) will cover the next full month's interest. The days from closing to month-end must be collected upfront.
