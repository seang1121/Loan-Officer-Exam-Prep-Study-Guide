## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

Understanding property types, appraisal methods, and title concepts is essential for the SAFE exam. These topics appear in application questions (what property types require special treatment?) and in fraud prevention (appraisal independence). Expect 8-12 questions.

---

### 1. Appraisal Methods — The Three Approaches

**An appraisal** is a professional opinion of market value performed by a licensed or certified appraiser.

**Market Value (Definition):**
The most probable price a property would sell for in an arm's-length transaction, with both buyer and seller acting in their own best interests, with reasonable knowledge of the facts, and without undue pressure.

---

**Approach 1: Sales Comparison Approach**

- **What it is:** Compares the subject property to recently sold similar properties (comparables/"comps")
- **Best for:** Residential properties (single-family homes, condos, 1-4 units)
- **How it works:**
  1. Find 3+ recent sales of similar properties nearby
  2. Adjust comps for differences (size, amenities, condition, location)
  3. Reconcile adjusted values to determine subject property value

**Adjustments:**
- Better comp = negative adjustment (subtract to equalize)
- Worse comp = positive adjustment (add to equalize)
- Example: Comp sold for $300,000 but has a pool (subject doesn't). Pool value ≈ $15,000 → adjusted comp = $285,000

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Sales Comparison is the **primary method** used for residential properties. The exam almost always asks this — "which method is most appropriate for a single-family residence?" Answer: Sales Comparison.

---

**Approach 2: Cost Approach**

- **What it is:** Estimates value as land value + depreciated cost to rebuild improvements
- **Formula:** Value = Land Value + (Replacement Cost - Depreciation)
- **Best for:** New construction, unique properties with few comps, special-purpose properties (churches, schools)

**Types of Depreciation:**
1. **Physical deterioration** — wear and tear, deferred maintenance (can be curable or incurable)
2. **Functional obsolescence** — outdated design (only one bathroom in a 4-bedroom house)
3. **External/Economic obsolescence** — neighborhood issues, nearby nuisances (always incurable)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Cost approach is best for **new construction** (no depreciation yet, comps may not exist) and **unique properties** (no comparable sales available).

---

**Approach 3: Income Approach**

- **What it is:** Estimates value based on the income the property can generate
- **Best for:** Income-producing properties (apartment buildings, commercial, rental properties)
- **Key Metric:** Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)

**Formula:**
```
Value = Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Cap Rate

NOI = Gross Income - Operating Expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance, management)
(NOT including mortgage payments — NOI is before debt service)
```

**Example:**
- Annual NOI: $50,000
- Market cap rate: 5%
- Estimated value: $50,000 ÷ 0.05 = **$1,000,000**

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Income approach is used for **investment properties**. Key concept: higher cap rate = lower value (riskier investment). Lower cap rate = higher value (safer investment).

---

**Appraisal Method Summary:**

| Method | Best For | Key Concept |
|---|---|---|
| Sales Comparison | **Residential (SFR)** | Adjust comps for differences |
| Cost Approach | **New construction, unique** | Land + depreciated replacement cost |
| Income Approach | **Investment properties** | NOI ÷ Cap Rate |

---

### 2. Appraiser Independence Requirements (AIR)

**Background:**
The Appraiser Independence Requirements (AIR) were established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2009 (replacing HVCC) and formalized through Dodd-Frank.

**Core Principles:**
- Appraisers must be **independent** from loan production
- MLOs and loan production staff **cannot** select, approve, oversee, or influence appraisers
- No pressure allowed on appraisers to hit a target value

**What Is PROHIBITED:**
- MLO ordering appraisal directly
- MLO selecting specific appraiser from panel
- Communicating a needed value to the appraiser
- Threatening to use a different appraiser if value comes in low
- Offering future business in exchange for a high value
- Withholding payment from appraiser for unsatisfactory value

**What IS Permitted:**
- Providing the appraiser with the purchase contract (so they know the agreed-upon price)
- Requesting a Reconsideration of Value (ROV) if value is believed to be wrong, with factual data
- Correcting factual errors in the appraisal
- Communicating with the appraiser about property information, access scheduling, etc.

**AMC Model:**
Most lenders use **Appraisal Management Companies (AMCs)** as intermediaries:
- AMC maintains a panel of approved appraisers
- AMC assigns orders (not the MLO)
- AMC reviews and manages the appraisal
- Eliminates direct contact between MLO and appraiser

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The MLO cannot select the appraiser or influence the value. The AMC model creates the firewall between loan production and appraisal.

---

### 3. Types of Value

| Type | Definition | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| **Market Value** | Price in an arm's-length transaction with informed buyer and seller | Mortgage underwriting |
| **Assessed Value** | Value determined by the county assessor for tax purposes | Property tax calculation |
| **Appraised Value** | Appraiser's professional opinion of market value | Mortgage lending decisions |
| **Insured Value** | Replacement cost for insurance purposes | Homeowner's insurance |
| **Liquidation Value** | Quick-sale value (below market) | Foreclosure/distressed sales |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Assessed value (for taxes) is often different from appraised value (for mortgage). Assessed value is set by the government; appraisal is done by a licensed professional. Don't confuse them.

---

### 4. Title — The Foundation of Property Ownership

**What Is Title?**
"Title" refers to legal ownership of a property. Having "title" means you legally own the property.

**Chain of Title:**
The historical record of all transfers of ownership of a property, from the original grant to the current owner. The chain of title must be unbroken.

**Title Search:**
A search of public records to verify:
- Who legally owns the property
- Whether there are any outstanding liens, encumbrances, or claims
- That the chain of title is complete and unbroken
- That the seller actually has the right to sell

---

**Title Insurance:**

Title insurance protects against losses from defects in title that weren't found in the search.

| Type | Who It Protects | Who Pays | When Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Owner's Policy** | The buyer/owner | Negotiable (buyer or seller pays per custom) | Optional for owner |
| **Lender's Policy** | The lender's interest | Buyer (almost always) | **Required for mortgage** |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Lender's title insurance is **almost always required** for any mortgage. It protects the lender — not the homeowner. The owner's policy is separate and protects the buyer. Encourage buyers to purchase BOTH.

**One-Time Premium:**
Unlike homeowner's insurance, title insurance is a one-time premium paid at closing. It covers the life of ownership.

---

**Title Issues and Defects:**

| Issue | Description |
|---|---|
| **Lien** | A legal claim against the property (mortgage, tax lien, mechanic's lien) |
| **Encumbrance** | Any claim or restriction on the property (liens, easements, restrictions) |
| **Easement** | The right of someone else to use a portion of the property (utility easement, right-of-way) |
| **Judgment** | Court-ordered money claim that attaches to the property |
| **Cloud on title** | Any condition that impairs clear title and must be resolved |
| **Lis pendens** | Notice of pending litigation involving the property |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** A lien, judgment, or easement is an **encumbrance** on title. Encumbrances don't always prevent a sale but must be disclosed and addressed.

---

### 5. Deed Types

A deed is the document that transfers ownership of property.

| Deed Type | Protection Level | What It Guarantees | Common Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **General Warranty Deed** | **Highest (strongest)** | Seller warrants title against ALL defects, including those before seller owned the property | Most residential sales |
| **Special Warranty Deed** | Medium | Seller warrants only against defects occurring DURING seller's ownership | Commercial transactions |
| **Quitclaim Deed** | **Lowest (weakest)** | Transfers whatever interest the grantor HAS — no guarantees | Transfers between family members, clearing title issues |
| **Bargain and Sale Deed** | Medium | Similar to quitclaim but implies seller has some interest | Some states, foreclosure sales |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** General Warranty = most protection (best for buyer). Quitclaim = no guarantees whatsoever. Exam will test this ordering.

---

### 6. Property Types and Special Considerations

**Single-Family Residence (SFR):**
- Standard property type — easiest to finance
- 1 unit, owner-occupied or investment

**2-4 Unit Properties:**
- Can be financed with residential mortgages (1-4 units = residential)
- Owner must typically occupy one unit for FHA/VA
- Higher down payment requirements on conventional (non-owner-occupied)
- Income from units used to offset housing expense

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** 1-4 units = residential mortgage territory. 5+ units = commercial lending.

---

**Condominiums:**
- Borrower owns the unit; HOA owns common areas
- FHA and VA have approved/eligible condo lists
- Lender must verify condo project eligibility (occupancy %, investor concentration, financial health of HOA)
- Warrantable vs. non-warrantable condos (non-warrantable = can't sell to FNMA/FHLMC)

**What Makes a Condo Non-Warrantable:**
- Single entity owns >10% of units (high investor concentration)
- HOA is in litigation
- Project is more than 20% commercial
- Insufficient HOA reserves
- Hotel/transient use allowed

---

**PUD — Planned Unit Development:**
- Individual homes with shared common areas and HOA
- Treated similarly to SFR for mortgage purposes
- HOA questionnaire typically required

---

**Manufactured Housing:**
- Built in a factory and transported to site
- "HUD Code" applies (not local building codes)
- Must be classified as real property (attached to permanent foundation) to get standard mortgage financing
- If on wheels or rented land = personal property (chattel loan)
- FHA has specific manufactured housing programs
- Often harder to finance than site-built homes

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Manufactured homes must be **permanently affixed to a foundation** and titled as real property to qualify for standard mortgage programs.

---

**Co-op (Cooperative):**
- Borrower purchases shares in a corporation that owns the building
- Not technically real property — it's personal property (stock)
- Financed with a "share loan" or "proprietary lease" — not a traditional mortgage
- Common in New York City; rare elsewhere

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Co-ops are financed differently from condos — they involve shares in a corporation, not a deed to real property. Fannie Mae has co-op programs but they're specialized.

---

### 7. Flood Zones and NFIP

**FEMA Flood Maps:**
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) maintains flood zone maps showing which areas are at risk of flooding.

**Key Flood Zone Designations:**

| Zone | Risk Level | Insurance Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **Zone A** | High-risk flood zone (no base flood elevation) | **Yes** |
| **Zone AE** | High-risk flood zone (with base flood elevation) | **Yes** |
| **Zone V** | Coastal high-risk zone (waves and surge) | **Yes** |
| **Zone X (shaded)** | Moderate risk | No (but recommended) |
| **Zone X (unshaded)** | Minimal risk | No |

**SFHA — Special Flood Hazard Area:**
Any Zone A or V designation — **flood insurance is required by federal law** if the property has a federally-backed mortgage.

**NFIP — National Flood Insurance Program:**
Federally administered flood insurance program that provides coverage where private insurance is unavailable or unaffordable.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** If a property is in a **SFHA (Special Flood Hazard Area)** and has a federally-backed mortgage, flood insurance is **mandatory**. This is a condition of the loan.

**Flood Certification:**
- Required on all mortgage transactions
- Third-party service checks FEMA maps to determine flood zone status
- Standard practice regardless of apparent flood risk

A) Add $8,000 to the comparable ($288,000)
B) Subtract $8,000 from the comparable ($272,000)
C) No adjustment needed — garages don't affect value
D) Use this comparable without adjustment and explain the difference in the narrative

---

### Answer Key

**1. B — Yes, providing a target value violates AIR.** Telling an appraiser a minimum value needed is prohibited pressure under AIR. Providing the purchase price is acceptable (appraisers get the purchase contract), but specifying a minimum acceptable value crosses the line.

**2. C — $2,500,000.** Value = NOI ÷ Cap Rate = $200,000 ÷ 0.08 = $2,500,000. (Not $200,000 × 8 = $1,600,000 — you divide, not multiply.)

**3. B — No warranty protection.** A quitclaim deed provides no warranties. The seller only transferred whatever interest they had, with no promise the title was clear. The buyer should have purchased title insurance to protect against exactly this scenario.

**4. B — Flood insurance required.** Zone AE is a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Federal law requires flood insurance on any property in an SFHA with a federally-backed (or federally-regulated lender) mortgage.

**5. C — Cost Approach.** For unique properties with no comparable sales, the Cost Approach (land value + depreciated replacement cost) is the most appropriate method since there's nothing to compare to.

**6. B — Non-warrantable — investor concentration over 10%.** Fannie Mae requires that no single entity own more than 10% of units in a condo project. At 15%, this condo would be non-warrantable and ineligible for sale to Fannie Mae.

**7. D — Easement.** A utility easement grants the company the right to use a portion of the property — this is an easement, a specific type of encumbrance.

**8. B — The lender's interest.** The lender's title policy protects the lender. A separate owner's policy would be needed to protect the buyer. One policy does not protect both.

**9. B — On permanent foundations, titled as real property.** Manufactured homes CAN qualify for standard mortgage financing IF they are permanently affixed to a foundation and titled as real property (not personal property). Mobile homes on rented land or not on permanent foundations typically cannot use standard mortgage programs.

**10. B — Subtract $8,000.** The comparable has something BETTER than the subject (two-car vs. one-car garage). To make the comparable equivalent to the subject, the appraiser subtracts the value of the superior feature: $280,000 - $8,000 = $272,000 adjusted value. Remember: adjust the COMPARABLE to match the SUBJECT.
