## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

Dodd-Frank reshaped the mortgage industry after the 2008 financial crisis. The CFPB, ATR rule, QM definition, and LO Compensation Rule are all direct products of Dodd-Frank — and they are heavily tested on the SAFE exam. Expect 10-15 questions in this area.

---

### 1. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010)

**Background:**
The 2008 financial crisis exposed rampant abuses in mortgage lending — liar loans, predatory products, unqualified borrowers, excessive leverage. Congress responded with the **Dodd-Frank Act**, signed into law July 21, 2010.

**Major Provisions for Mortgage MLOs:**
| Provision | What It Did |
|---|---|
| Created the CFPB | Single consumer financial protection agency |
| Ability-to-Repay (ATR) Rule | Lenders must verify borrower can repay |
| Qualified Mortgage (QM) | Safe harbor product standards |
| LO Compensation Rule | Banned steering incentives |
| TRID (Know Before You Owe) | Replaced GFE/HUD-1 with LE/CD |
| Appraisal Independence | Formalized AIR requirements |
| Risk Retention | "Skin in the game" requirements |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Dodd-Frank was enacted in **2010** in response to the **2008 financial crisis**. The CFPB began operations in **2011**.

### 2. CFPB — Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

**What It Is:**
The CFPB is an independent federal agency created by Dodd-Frank to protect consumers in the financial marketplace. It is the primary enforcer of federal consumer financial laws related to mortgages.

**Key Facts:**
- Created by **Dodd-Frank Act (2010)**, began operations **July 21, 2011**
- Headquartered in Washington, D.C.
- Funded through the Federal Reserve (not congressional appropriations — making it more independent)
- Led by a single director

**CFPB's Authority:**
- Supervisory authority over banks with **$10 billion+** in assets
- Supervisory authority over **all non-bank mortgage companies** regardless of size
- Rulemaking authority for federal consumer financial laws
- Enforcement authority — can fine institutions and seek restitution for consumers

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The CFPB supervises ALL non-bank mortgage lenders — even tiny ones. For banks, only those with $10B+ in assets fall under direct CFPB supervision; smaller banks are supervised by their primary regulator.

**Laws the CFPB Enforces:**
- TILA (Truth in Lending Act)
- RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act)
- ECOA (Equal Credit Opportunity Act)
- HMDA (Home Mortgage Disclosure Act)
- FCRA (Fair Credit Reporting Act)
- SAFE Act (licensing)
- And many more

### 3. Ability-to-Repay (ATR) Rule

**What It Is:**
Dodd-Frank requires lenders to make a reasonable, good-faith determination that a borrower has the **ability to repay** a mortgage before originating it. This is codified in TILA under Regulation Z.

**The 8 ATR Underwriting Factors:**

Lenders must consider and verify all of the following:

| # | Factor | What to Verify |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Current or reasonably expected income or assets** | Pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements |
| 2 | **Current employment status** | Verification of Employment (VOE) |
| 3 | **Monthly payment on the covered transaction** | Calculate PITI + mortgage insurance |
| 4 | **Monthly payment on any simultaneous loans** | Any other loans closing at the same time |
| 5 | **Monthly payments for mortgage-related obligations** | Taxes, insurance, HOA dues, special assessments |
| 6 | **Current debt obligations, alimony, and child support** | All monthly debt payments |
| 7 | **Monthly DTI ratio or residual income** | Front-end and back-end DTI |
| 8 | **Credit history** | Credit report review |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** There are **8** ATR factors. The exam may ask you to identify which factor is missing from a list, or which factor a lender violated. Memorize all 8.

**Who Must Comply:**
- All creditors making **closed-end residential mortgage loans** secured by the consumer's dwelling
- Does NOT apply to: open-end credit (HELOCs), timeshare loans, reverse mortgages, temporary loans (bridge loans < 12 months)

**ATR Violation:**
If a lender fails to properly assess ATR, the borrower has a defense against foreclosure AND a private right of action for damages.

---

### 4. Qualified Mortgage (QM)

**What It Is:**
A Qualified Mortgage is a category of loan that provides lenders with a **safe harbor** from ATR liability. If you made a QM loan, you're presumed to have complied with the ATR rule.

**QM Requirements — The "Can't Haves":**
| Prohibited Feature | Why |
|---|---|
| No negative amortization | Balance can't grow |
| No interest-only periods | Borrower must pay principal |
| No balloon payments (generally) | No lump sum at end |
| No loan terms over 30 years | |
| Points & fees ≤ 3% of loan amount | (Adjusted for smaller loans) |
| DTI ratio ≤ 43% | General QM only |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** QM prohibitions are the "no bad loan features" list. If a loan has negative amortization, interest-only, balloon, or terms > 30 years — it is NOT a QM.

**Types of QM:**

| QM Type | DTI Limit | Eligible For |
|---|---|---|
| **General QM** | DTI ≤ 43% | All eligible loans |
| **GSE Patch QM** (expired 2021) | DTI > 43% allowed if DU/LPA approve | FNMA/FHLMC loans (phased out) |
| **Small Creditor QM** | DTI ≤ 43% (portfolio) | Small lenders (<$2B, <2,000 loans) |
| **Balloon QM** | Special rules | Small creditors in rural/underserved areas |

**The 3% Points and Fees Cap:**
For a loan to be a QM, total points and fees cannot exceed:
- **3%** of the loan amount for loans $100,000+
- **$3,000** for loans $60,000 to $100,000
- **5%** of loan for loans $20,000 to $60,000
- **$1,000** for loans $12,500 to $20,000
- **8%** for loans under $12,500

What counts as "points and fees":
- Origination charges
- Points (discount and origination)
- Title service charges paid to an affiliate
- Mortgage insurance premiums (above PMI limits)
- Compensation paid to MLO (all forms)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** For standard loans, remember **3% cap** on points and fees for QM status. This is directly tested.

**Safe Harbor vs. Rebuttable Presumption:**

| | Safe Harbor | Rebuttable Presumption |
|---|---|---|
| **What it means** | Complete protection — can't be sued for ATR violation | Borrower CAN challenge, but bears burden of proof |
| **When it applies** | Rate is not "higher-priced" | Rate is higher-priced (HPML) but QM features present |
| **Standard QM** | APR ≤ APOR + 1.5% | APR > APOR + 1.5% |

---

### 5. LO Compensation Rule (LO Comp Rule)

**What It Is:**
Under Dodd-Frank and Regulation Z, loan originators cannot be compensated based on the terms of the loans they originate.

**Prohibited Compensation:**
- No compensation based on:
  - Interest rate
  - APR
  - Points
  - LTV ratio
  - Type of loan product
  - ANY loan term

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** An MLO CANNOT be paid more because they put a borrower in a higher-rate loan. This is the heart of the LO Comp Rule.

**Dual Compensation Prohibited:**
- A loan originator cannot receive compensation from **both** the lender (institution) AND the borrower for the same transaction
- If the borrower pays the MLO directly (borrower-paid compensation), the lender cannot also compensate the MLO
- Exception: A loan originator CAN receive a salary plus bonuses not tied to loan terms

**Permissible Compensation:**
- Flat salary
- Hourly pay
- Volume-based bonuses (number of loans, NOT loan terms)
- Bonuses based on long-term profitability (not individual loan terms)
- Contributions to a profit-sharing plan or 401(k)

**Steering Prohibition:**
The LO Comp Rule also prohibits steering borrowers to loans that are not in their interest. An MLO cannot steer a borrower to a higher-rate loan because it results in higher compensation.

**Safe Harbor from Steering Prohibition:**
A loan originator who presents the borrower with loan options in three product categories is protected:
- The lowest interest rate option
- The lowest points and fees option
- The lowest rate for a product without risky features (no negative amortization, interest-only, balloon, etc.)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The LO Comp Rule "safe harbor" requires presenting the borrower with at least **3 loan options** covering these categories.

---

### 6. Volcker Rule

**What It Is:**
Section 619 of Dodd-Frank — prohibits banks and their affiliates from:
- **Proprietary trading** (trading securities for the bank's own account/profit)
- Owning or sponsoring **hedge funds or private equity funds**

**Purpose:** Prevent banks from taking excessive risks with deposits that are federally insured.

**Exceptions:**
- Market making (facilitating customer trades)
- Underwriting
- Risk-mitigating hedging
- Trading in U.S. government/agency securities

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The Volcker Rule primarily applies to banks — it's more of a Wall Street rule than a mortgage rule, but it's tested because it came from Dodd-Frank. Know: Volcker = no proprietary trading by banks.

---

### Key Dodd-Frank Timeline

| Year | Event |
|---|---|
| 2008 | Financial crisis |
| July 2010 | Dodd-Frank Act signed into law |
| July 2011 | CFPB begins operations |
| January 2014 | ATR/QM Rule becomes effective |
| October 2015 | TRID becomes effective (TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosures) |

---

### How ATR, QM, and the LO Comp Rule Work Together

```
Borrower applies → Lender assesses ATR (8 factors) → 
  If QM: Safe harbor from ATR lawsuit
  If not QM: Lender still OK if they can prove ATR compliance
MLO compensation: Cannot be based on loan terms (LO Comp Rule)
```

The system is designed so that:
1. Lenders must verify ability to repay (ATR)
2. Loans with good features get legal protection (QM)
3. MLOs have no financial incentive to put borrowers in bad loans (LO Comp)

### Answer Key

**1. C — The LO Compensation Rule.** Paying MLOs more for higher-rate loans is precisely what the LO Comp Rule prohibits — it creates a financial incentive to steer borrowers to worse loans.

**2. B — Cannot be a QM.** QM loans cannot have terms exceeding 30 years. A 40-year loan fails this requirement regardless of other features.

**3. C — Exact FICO score.** The ATR rule requires considering "credit history" — not a specific FICO score number. The 8 factors are broadly defined; a specific credit score is a tool used to assess credit history but not a separate ATR factor.

**4. C — The mortgage company.** The CFPB directly supervises all non-bank mortgage companies regardless of size. Banks are only subject to direct CFPB supervision if they have $10 billion+ in assets.

**5. B — Rebuttable presumption.** When a QM loan's APR exceeds APOR by more than 1.5% (making it a higher-priced QM), it receives rebuttable presumption protection instead of full safe harbor. The borrower can challenge ATR compliance but bears the burden of proof.

**6. B — Number of loans originated.** Volume-based compensation (number of loans) is permissible. What's prohibited is compensation based on loan terms (rate, APR, points, type, etc.).

**7. C — Address abuses contributing to the 2008 financial crisis.** Dodd-Frank was a direct response to the mortgage crisis, predatory lending, and excessive risk-taking that caused the 2008 collapse.

**8. C — Variable commission based on rate.** This directly ties MLO pay to the interest rate (a loan term), which is exactly what the LO Comp Rule prohibits.

**9. C — A balloon payment due in 7 years.** Balloon payments disqualify a loan from QM status (with narrow exceptions for small creditors in rural areas). Adjustable rates and above-market rates don't automatically disqualify a loan.

**10. B — The Federal Reserve.** The CFPB is funded through transfers from the Federal Reserve's earnings, not congressional appropriations. This was designed to make it more independent from political pressure.
