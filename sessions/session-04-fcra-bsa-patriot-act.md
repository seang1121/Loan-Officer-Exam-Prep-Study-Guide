## 📖 PART 1: TOPIC DEEP DIVE

### Why This Session Matters

This session covers laws that protect consumers (FCRA), prevent money laundering (BSA/AML), and combat terrorism (PATRIOT Act). Mortgage fraud red flags are consistently tested. Expect 8-12 questions in this area.

---

### 1. FCRA — Fair Credit Reporting Act

**What It Is:**
The Fair Credit Reporting Act governs the collection, use, and disclosure of consumer credit information. It protects consumers from inaccurate credit reporting and unauthorized use of their credit information.

**Enforced by:** CFPB (and FTC for non-covered entities)

---

**Permissible Purposes for Pulling a Credit Report:**

A consumer reporting agency (CRA) can only furnish a credit report for a **permissible purpose**:
- **Credit transactions** (the consumer applied for credit)
- **Employment purposes** (with written consent)
- **Insurance underwriting**
- **Government licensing** (background checks)
- **Legitimate business need** involving a business transaction with the consumer
- **Court order or federal grand jury subpoena**
- **Child support** determination

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Pulling someone's credit report for no legitimate reason (curiosity, stalking an ex) is a **FCRA violation**. Only pull credit when there's a permissible purpose.

---

**Adverse Action Notices Under FCRA:**

When credit is denied based **in whole or in part** on information from a consumer report, the creditor must:

1. Provide an **adverse action notice** to the consumer
2. The notice must include:
   - Name, address, phone number of the CRA that provided the report
   - Statement that the CRA did NOT make the decision
   - Consumer's right to get a **free copy** of the report within 60 days
   - Consumer's right to dispute inaccurate information

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Both ECOA and FCRA require adverse action notices when credit is denied — but for DIFFERENT reasons. ECOA = you must state specific reasons for denial. FCRA = you must identify the CRA and tell the consumer their rights.

---

**Dispute Process Under FCRA:**

If a consumer believes information is inaccurate:
1. Consumer disputes directly with the CRA (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
2. CRA must investigate within **30 days** (45 days if dispute submitted during free annual report period)
3. CRA must forward dispute to the furnisher (the bank or creditor that reported the info)
4. Furnisher must investigate and report back to CRA
5. If found inaccurate, must be corrected or deleted
6. If investigation is incomplete after 30 days, item must be deleted

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **30 days** to investigate a credit dispute. This is a commonly tested number.

---

**Credit Reporting Timeframes:**

| Item | Reporting Period |
|---|---|
| Most negative information | **7 years** from date of first delinquency |
| Bankruptcy (Chapter 7) | **10 years** from filing date |
| Bankruptcy (Chapter 13) | **7 years** from filing date |
| Tax liens (unpaid) | Until paid, then 7 years |
| Judgments | 7 years OR statute of limitations, whichever is longer |
| Positive information | **No limit** — can report forever |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Chapter 7 = 10 years. Chapter 13 = 7 years. Most other negatives = 7 years. These are directly tested.

---

**Free Annual Credit Report:**

Under FCRA, consumers are entitled to **one free credit report per year** from each of the three major CRAs through AnnualCreditReport.com.

Additional free reports are triggered by:
- Adverse action denial
- Fraud/identity theft
- Being on public assistance
- Unemployment and seeking work

---

**FCRA and Mortgage Lending:**

When you pull a borrower's credit report for a mortgage application:
- You need the borrower's **written authorization** (on the loan application)
- You must provide the borrower with a copy of the credit report if adverse action is taken based on it
- You must provide credit score disclosure if a credit score was used

**Credit Score Disclosure:**
If a credit score is used in connection with a credit decision, the lender must provide the consumer:
- The credit score
- Range of possible scores
- Key factors that adversely affected the score (up to 4 factors)
- Date score was created
- Name of CRA or model that generated the score

---

### 2. BSA/AML — Bank Secrecy Act & Anti-Money Laundering

**What It Is:**
The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) of 1970 requires financial institutions to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering. The BSA is the backbone of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) framework.

**Administered by:** **FinCEN** — Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department)

---

**The Three Stages of Money Laundering:**

| Stage | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Placement** | Introducing dirty money into the financial system | Depositing drug money into a bank |
| **Layering** | Obscuring the source through transactions | Moving money between accounts, buying/selling assets |
| **Integration** | Making the money appear legitimate | Purchasing real estate with seemingly clean funds |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Mortgage transactions are often used in the **integration** stage — buying real estate to legitimize dirty money.

---

**Currency Transaction Report (CTR):**

- Filed when a financial institution handles a **cash transaction of more than $10,000**
- Must be filed within **15 days** of the transaction
- Filed with FinCEN
- Covers multiple transactions by the same person in a single day if they total more than $10,000 (aggregation rule)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The CTR threshold is **$10,000** (more than $10,000 — so $10,000 exactly does NOT require a CTR; $10,001 does). Memorize this.

---

**Suspicious Activity Report (SAR):**

- Filed when a financial institution suspects a transaction involves money laundering, fraud, or other illegal activity
- Must be filed within **30 days** of detecting suspicious activity
- Can be extended to **60 days** if additional evidence is needed to identify a subject
- Filed with FinCEN
- **Confidential** — financial institutions cannot tell the subject that a SAR was filed ("tipping off" is illegal)

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** SAR = 30 days. CTR = cash over $10K. These numbers are almost always on the exam.

**When to File a SAR (Triggers):**
- Transaction involves $5,000 or more and is known or suspected to involve illegal activity
- Any transaction that the institution knows or has reason to suspect is designed to evade CTR requirements
- Any transaction that has no lawful purpose or is not the type of transaction the person would normally conduct

---

**Structuring (Illegal):**

Structuring = intentionally breaking up cash transactions to avoid the CTR requirement. Also called "smurfing."

**Example:** Instead of depositing $15,000 at once, a person deposits $8,000 on Monday and $7,000 on Tuesday to stay under the $10,000 threshold.

This is ILLEGAL — a federal crime under 31 U.S.C. § 5324 — even if the money is completely legal.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** Structuring is illegal regardless of whether the underlying money is legal or illegal. The ACT of breaking up deposits to avoid reporting is the crime.

---

**AML Program Requirements:**

Financial institutions must maintain a written AML compliance program with four components (the "Four Pillars"):
1. **Policies and procedures** — written AML policies
2. **Designated compliance officer** — a BSA/AML officer
3. **Training** — ongoing training for employees
4. **Independent testing** — periodic internal/external audits

**Fifth Pillar (added 2016):**
5. **Customer Due Diligence (CDD)** — know your customer (KYC), identify beneficial owners

---

**Record Keeping Requirements Under BSA:**

| Record | Retention Period |
|---|---|
| CTR filings | 5 years |
| SAR filings | 5 years |
| Currency transaction records | 5 years |
| Records of wire transfers | 5 years |

---

### 3. USA PATRIOT Act — Customer Identification Program (CIP)

**What It Is:**
The USA PATRIOT Act (2001) was enacted after 9/11 to combat terrorism financing. Section 326 requires financial institutions to implement a **Customer Identification Program (CIP)**.

**Administered by:** FinCEN (Treasury Department) in coordination with federal banking regulators

---

**CIP Requirements:**

Before opening an account or originating a loan, financial institutions must verify the identity of each customer using **4 required identifying elements:**

| Element | Details |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Legal name |
| **Date of birth** | For individuals |
| **Address** | Residential or business address |
| **Identification number** | SSN (U.S. persons), passport number, or alien identification number (non-U.S. persons) |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** The 4 CIP elements are: **Name, Date of Birth, Address, ID Number**. These appear on the exam as "what 4 things must be verified?"

---

**CIP Verification Methods:**

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| **Documentary** | Government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport) |
| **Non-documentary** | Credit reports, public databases, references from other financial institutions |

Institutions must verify identity within a **reasonable time** before or after account opening (not necessarily at the exact moment of opening).

---

**OFAC Screening:**

Under the PATRIOT Act, financial institutions must screen customers against the **OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) list** — the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.

- Cannot do business with sanctioned individuals, entities, or countries
- Must freeze assets and report to OFAC if a match is found

---

**Beneficial Ownership Rule (FinCEN):**

For legal entities (LLCs, corporations) opening accounts:
- Must identify **beneficial owners** — individuals who own 25%+ of the entity
- Must identify one person with significant management control

---

### 4. FinCEN — Financial Crimes Enforcement Network

**What It Is:**
FinCEN is a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that collects and analyzes financial intelligence to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.

**FinCEN's Role:**
- Administers the BSA
- Receives CTR, SAR, and other BSA filings
- Shares financial intelligence with law enforcement
- Issues guidance and regulations for AML compliance
- Operates the BSA E-Filing System

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** FinCEN = Treasury Department bureau = administers BSA. Don't confuse with CFPB (consumer protection) or HUD (housing).

---

### 5. Red Flags for Mortgage Fraud

**The Big Picture:**
Mortgage fraud occurs when any party knowingly misrepresents, omits, or falsifies information on a mortgage application or related documents. It can be committed by borrowers, sellers, appraisers, real estate agents, or MLOs.

**Two Categories of Mortgage Fraud:**
1. **Fraud for property** — borrower lies to get a loan they otherwise wouldn't qualify for
2. **Fraud for profit** — industry participants scheme to extract equity or fees from a transaction

---

**Common Mortgage Fraud Schemes:**

| Scheme | Description | Red Flags |
|---|---|---|
| **Inflated Appraisals** | Appraiser overstates property value | Sale price well above comps, appraiser is friend of seller |
| **Straw Buyers** | Someone with good credit buys property for someone else | Buyer shows no interest in property, plans to "give" it to someone else |
| **Income Fraud** | Falsifying income on application | Tax returns don't match application income, self-employment not verifiable |
| **Occupancy Fraud** | Stating primary residence when investment property | Borrower already has primary residence they recently bought |
| **Identity Theft** | Using another person's identity to get a loan | Borrower unfamiliar with their own information, doesn't know their SSN |
| **Equity Skimming** | Buying distressed property, collecting rent, not paying mortgage | Property sells quickly, new owner doesn't occupy |
| **Property Flipping** | Buying and reselling rapidly with inflated value | Very short ownership period before resale, multiple sales of same property |
| **Silent Second** | Seller secretly funds down payment as undisclosed second mortgage | Borrower has no documented source for down payment |

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **Straw buyers** are one of the most commonly tested fraud schemes. The actual buyer uses another person's name and credit to obtain a mortgage they couldn't otherwise qualify for.

> ⚡ **Exam Tip:** **Occupancy fraud** is very common — claiming a property will be a primary residence (lower rate) when it will actually be a rental or second home.

---

**MLO Responsibility:**

MLOs have a duty to:
- Report suspected fraud to their compliance department
- NOT assist in completing fraudulent applications
- Maintain records that could help identify fraud
- File SARs if they work at an institution with SAR filing obligations

---

**FRAUD vs. MISREPRESENTATION:**

| | Fraud | Innocent Misrepresentation |
|---|---|---|
| Intent | Deliberate | Mistake/accident |
| Example | Borrower knowingly states false income | Borrower accidentally transposes a digit on income |
| Legal consequence | Criminal liability | Potentially voidable contract |

---

### Answer Key

**1. B — Income fraud.** When stated income on an application is significantly higher than what's shown on tax returns, this is a classic indicator of income fraud.

**2. C — Structuring.** Breaking up transactions to stay below the $10,000 CTR threshold is called structuring (or "smurfing") and is illegal under the BSA.

**3. B — 7 years.** Most negative information stays on a credit report for 7 years. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is the exception at 10 years.

**4. D — Department of the Treasury.** FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) is a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department.

**5. B — CTR within 15 days.** Cash transactions exceeding $10,000 require a Currency Transaction Report filed within 15 days.

**6. B — Email address.** The four required CIP elements are: Name, Date of Birth, Address, and Identification Number. Email is not required.

**7. B — Name and contact information of the CRA.** Under FCRA, the adverse action notice must identify the credit reporting agency that provided the report, along with the consumer's right to a free report and to dispute inaccuracies.

**8. B — An undisclosed second mortgage used to fund the down payment.** A "silent second" is when the seller secretly loans the buyer money for the down payment (as a second mortgage), which is not disclosed to the primary lender — this is mortgage fraud.

**9. B — 30 days.** Under FCRA, a CRA has 30 days to investigate a dispute (45 days if the dispute was submitted with the annual free report request).

**10. C — FinCEN.** All CTR and SAR filings go to FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network).
